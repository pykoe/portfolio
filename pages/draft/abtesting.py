# In this example:
#
#    We generate two sets of random data for group A and group B.
#    We use a two-sample t-test from scipy.stats to compare the means of the two groups.
#    The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the groups.
#    We check if the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (alpha, typically 0.05) to determine statistical significance.
#
#  This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you would replace the random data with actual data from your A and B groups, ensuring randomization and proper experimental design.

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Generate random data for two groups (A and B)
np.random.seed(42)

group_A = np.random.normal(loc=25, scale=5, size=1000)  # Sample data for group A
group_B = np.random.normal(loc=30, scale=5, size=1000)  # Sample data for group B

# Perform a two-sample t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_A, group_B)

# Output the results
print("A/B Test Results:")
print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")

# Check if the results are statistically significant
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Results are statistically significant. Reject the null hypothesis.")
else:
    print("Results are not statistically significant. Fail to reject the null hypothesis.")
