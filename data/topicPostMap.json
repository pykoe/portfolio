We didn\u2019t have a throwaway society, but it has developed in the last 100 years. Ford, for example, envisaged that if you bought your Model C, you would keep it for life. A whole aftermarket industry, especially in the U.S., supplied bits for it. If your Model T was too basic (and they were very basic), you could add all sorts of things. Many of those were designed by ordinary drivers, ordinary citizens, and small-scale inventors.\n\nIn the 1920s and thirties, the car industry was gradually professionalised, whereby the car industry decided \u201cWe don\u2019t want all these people tinkering with our products. We want to control everything.\u201d \n\nThis has now taken an extreme form with Tesla. Tesla has a total control system to the extent that if you start fiddling around with a Tesla, a voice will come out of the car and say, \u201cWhat are you doing to our cars?\u201d\n\nProduct durability is not just a technological issue, it\u2019s also a psychological issue. You must build a relationship with the product to look after it and to make it last a long time. \n\n**The classical movement**\nThis could form a model for a future, more durable car. But that would mean the manufacturer needs to give up some control frequency. That is going to be a real challenge. However, all over the world, freedom-to-tinker legislation is popping up for various sectors where consumers will be given an inherent right to do things to the products once they\u2019ve bought them.\n\n**Product Management, Leasing**\nWhat about a product surface system approach whereby the end user doesn\u2019t own the product, but the manufacturer or a management company manages it? That, of course, means that you would have less ownership of the product and less of that bond. Within an ownership model, it\u2019s easier to build that bond. You can have more intensive use of a product if you think of car-sharing schemes, for example, car clubs. You get the intensive life out of the product in a shorter period than with the ownership model.\n\n**Waste Stream**\nThe only problem when thinking of the circular economy is controlling that waste stream. If you have a very intensively used product, you still have a fast waste stream, and you need to work out how to deal with that. Whereas with a personal ownership model, your waste stream could be delayed. For example, if a car lasts 30 years instead of 15, that hinders the waste stream quite a bit.", "post_number": 1, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 10, "readers_count": 9, "incoming_link_count": 7, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 36.8, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "inge", "reply_to_post_id": 119727}, {"topic_id": 18041, "post_id": 119728, "username": "inge", "user_id": 1856, "created_at": "2022-11-16T05:34:51.690Z", "raw": "another topic - we can distill some questions out of this more @ivan", "post_number": 2, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 10, "readers_count": 9, "incoming_link_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 6.8, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "inge", "reply_to_post_id": 119727}, {"topic_id": 18041, "post_id": 136251, "username": "jcoate", "user_id": 6952, "created_at": "2023-12-23T16:04:07.702Z", "raw": "The problem largely is that car companies want you to trade in your car as soon as the warranty runs out.

And of course, it\u2019s bigger in some countries than in others, especially in countries like Japan and Germany. In these countries, there is strict legislation regarding periodic testing. But they aren't necessarily there to protect consumers. \n\nIn Japan, they have a rigorous periodic testing regime. Essentially, after five years, you must completely rebuild your braking system. Cars are expensive to repair in Japan but cheap to buy. Many people decide they\u2019ll buy a new car after five or seven years, and the old cars are shipped somewhere. The biggest market for those is New Zealand. New Zealand deports between 120 and 150,000 used Japanese cars every year. And again, most ordinary New Zealanders drive those used Japanese cars and keep them going. Some flows go from there into East Africa and the Caribbean. A similar flow goes from South Korea into Russia via Vladivostok. \n\nThe reason for these strict rules is purely to protect domestic car manufacturers. That\u2019s the main driver. And that\u2019s also why the German, too, is quite rigorous. And why in Germany you can\u2019t modify cars. That sort of legislation is driven by the car manufacturers under the guise of safety but has very little to do with safety.\n\nIn the 1970s, Polish researchers studied how long a car could last by using different materials on behalf of the German government on assessing. They deny all knowledge of it, but Paul Nieuwenhuis has a copy and referenced it in many of his works. The research reckons a car can easily last 25 to 30 years with minor improvements.\n\nSo what happens with these cars? How long do they stay on the road?

Modern cars are basically computers on wheels. \"Basically\" here refers to the business model: this is where the money is made. \n2. The business model underpinning car electronics (and therefore the car as a whole, seen as the money is made in the electronics) is extractive and dehumanizing.\n   > Your car's digital infrastructure is a costly, dangerous nightmare \u2013 but for automakers in pursuit of postcapitalist utopia, it's a dream they can't give up on.\n3. Digital systems in cars are a problem because they are a source of \"repair nightmares, costly recalls and digital vulnerabilities\". Also, drivers hate them, and they are the source of most complaints that car buyers have towards manufacturers. \n4. However, digital systems enable a \"feudal\" mode of rent extraction from drivers to manufacturers. This is exemplified by [BMW renting you the seatwarmer in your own car](https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/02/big-river/#beemers), or [Mercedes renting you your own car's accelerator pedal](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/23/23474969/mercedes-car-subscription-faster-acceleration-feature-price) (comes at 1,200 USD a year to unlock a fully functional accelerator curve). \n5. Onboard digital systems also dovetail well with the financialization of the automotive industry. Big Car makes way more money selling car *loans*, securitizing those loans into derivatives and speculating on those, than it does making cars. Onboard electronics allows digital versions of the loan shark's goon: [some Tesla models allegedly lock themselves, then blare their horns when the repossession man arrives](https://tiremeetsroad.com/2021/03/18/tesla-allegedly-remotely-unlocks-model-3-owners-car-uses-smart-summon-to-help-repo-agent/). \n\nSo, maybe a humane solution to making onboard electronics more circular is to not have them at all. It's not like they are delivering much well-being anyway. I would wholeheartedly support Edgeryders making this suggestion in TREASURE deliverables.\n\n**Update**. I found another Doctorow post that focuses specifically on Tesla: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/edison-not-tesla/#demon-haunted-world.\n\n> Take Tesla's batteries: you pay for the battery when you buy your car, but you don't *own* that battery. You have to rent the right to use its full capacity, with Tesla reserving the right to reduce how far you go on a charge based on your willingness to pay. [...] hat's just one of the many rent-a-features that Tesla drivers have to shell out for. You don't own your car at all: when you sell it as a used vehicle, Tesla strips out these features you paid for and makes the next driver pay again, reducing the value of your used car and transfering it to Tesla's shareholders.\n\nDoctorow believes that the techno-legal institutions that underpins all this is DRMs. If they were not in place, we would probably see a completely different approach to onboard electronics. In the current landscape, onboard electronics do \"bullshit work\", making the world actively worse. If our data tell this story, then we can turn around and recommend to the EU to change the regulation around *DRMs*, not recycling, and by this route increase the circularity of cars: simply make it less profitable to equip cars with hard-to-recycle electronics.", "post_number": 1, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 28, "readers_count": 27, "incoming_link_count": 30, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 215.6, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "alberto", "reply_to_post_id": 130332}, {"topic_id": 18991, "post_id": 130344, "username": "petussing", "user_id": 4640, "created_at": "2023-07-29T16:15:22.537Z", "raw": "Hi, Alberto-\n\nNice to be back to economics.\n\nIMHO, Doctorow has a valid point. Intellectual Property is the source of the majority of profits being made in the United States at this time, and shareholders of firms that are built around IP ae making the vast majority of profits that have driven the Dow to new highs for the last couple of DECADES.\n\nI wish he were not spouting expletives ALL the time -- it seems to be the way to ensure that readers take in what you are saying, but I was taught 'way back when that expletives are a lazy writer's method to galvanize the audience. And that aside, it ensures that your audience is all always only \"fellow travelers\", and prevents anyone else form being persuaded by what you are actually getting at. But anyway...\n\nUnited States businesses make most of their money from IP, and so the US government has been fighting hard to defend IP globally. In principle this is a great thing -- it means that the design of a product can be separated from the manufacture of a product. Inasmuch as it is a very reasonable position that most of the value of a product resides in its design, this enables the value of the most valuable component of a given product can be allocated to its most valuable part. It enables the US, which has a lot of design infrastructure and a highly skilled, highly paid work force for designing products, to expand and enhance that part of the economy and take advantage of the long-standing US comparative advantage in resources of production of \"high human capital\" to expand the American economy. Very good, so far. But as we know, unless carefully regulated this can be manipulated to produce all sorts of negative effects. One is the manipulation of the location of the IP to a place other than where it was actually produced, to take advantage of tax benefits -- this has definitely caught the attention of global regulators, and a lot of effort is being put into minimizing it. This is for obvious reasons -- governments depend on tax revenues, and look less kindly on companies that try to take their income from them.\n\nBut it is in the area of consumer protection, as Doctorow points out, that companies can have the most pernicious effects. I don't need to say it over again. Even if you are able to delete the scatology, the point is clear and well-made: companies have takes full advantage of the lack of consumer protections to increase their profits.\n\nThat this happens is NOT due to \"corporate greed\" as such -- as I am always pointing out, all humans are greedy all the time -- the only difference is how influential they are in being able to capitalize on their greed. This, after all, is the reason why Marxism was a failure (sorry, Corey) -- it had as hard a time balancing the interests of various groups in its way as more capitalist countries have had reining in capitalists. In Communist countries, as anyone who has ever lived in one can easily attest (generally with the same level of invective as Doctorow spills on Capitalists), the Party Elite are the ones who take greatest advantage of the surplus generated by production. Look at China -- this is precisely what has been going on there for decades.\n\nAnother factor that Doctorow doesn't take into account, but which is absolutely important, is the toll that this focus on extracting the surplus through IP protection takes on productivity. If a worker does not take home as much as they are worth, they are less inclined to work as hard. If a consumer is continually being milked for their surplus, they are less interested in acquiring the product. Productivity growth has been much lower in advanced economies than new technology would seem to make likely -- surely a major factor is the imposition of such IP controls that favor producers.\n\nSo sure, Corey, this is a reason why the current iteration of the mixed economy in the USA, which is heavy on capitalism, is failing to provide a reasonable distribution of the surplus: it is too heavily influenced by those who make money from the generation of the surplus -- and currently the surplus is most easily generated by IP. That said, don't suppose that capitalists alone can benefit. We see in the US a revival on the Democratic side of the idea of unions. There is a lot of rhetoric about how they should revive, their influence has declined, etc. -- all of which makes sense and is valid. Workers should also have a \"fair\" share in the surplus generated by their own production. But this is dangerous. In significant ways, workers and industrial capitalists are on the same side of the story -- both want to be fed from the surplus generated by production and the benefits it confers on consumers. But nowhere in this fight is a real voice on behalf of consumers, the third party in the equation. Very broadly, the Republican Party represents the interests of producers; the Democratic Party represents the interests of workers (plus also producers, though to a somewhat lesser extent); consumers are represented by no one. This is because producers and workers each have a vital interest in this fight, can clearly see the benefit of working as a group on their own benefit (and sometimes together), but the interests of consumers are generally broad and diffuse, such that each consumer does not recognize a vital benefit in protecting their own interests.\n\nThis raises another point, which was cogently described by the conservative Nobel-winning economist James M. Buchanan: government workers, under the heading of \"Public Choice Theory\". The problem in Communist systems has been that the surplus has been scooped up by government workers -- this has also been a huge issue in developing countries, under the heading of \"corruption\" (a value-laden term, obviously). The point is that every person who runs a government department wants to increase the number of workers and budget of their department. In a government, there is not the same curb on expansion that exists in a company -- a company has an incentive to keep departments within their bureaucracy at something like the value they contribute to the product produced -- otherwise there is a reduction in the profits to everyone else -- even in a company whose profits have been inflated by IP or other monopoly control this is true, though to a lesser extent -- they are selling something, and need customers. A government in theory has access to all of the surplus in the country, via the tax system, and so they have much less constraint on spending from this perspective.\n\nUltimately, in order to function more efficiently, a government needs to balance ALL FOUR of these interests. To some extent this is happening, but the rhetoric around each group is so toxic that it makes it hard to realize that all of us are in it together.", "post_number": 2, "reply_count": 2, "reads": 21, "readers_count": 20, "incoming_link_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 34.2, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "alberto", "reply_to_post_id": 130332}, {"topic_id": 18991, "post_id": 130356, "username": "Nica", "user_id": 7620, "created_at": "2023-07-30T01:16:03.415Z", "raw": "Really interesting, @alberto thanks for this!\n\nThis dovetails with that interesting discussion I had with a professor of sustainable infrastructure about our paper at the ISIE conference.

(although I do enjoy the comic) Anyway, that's why I say \"something like the value\" -- there is a good deal of leeway, but not as much as in government. I used to live in the Middle East, and later I traveled in the region as a sales representative for an equipment firm. The norm was that (literally) in every department there were two people who did all the work, and who were always there -- almost always they were the deputy head (almost never the head, who was a figurehead, or a relative of someone important) and his secretary. Everyone else collects a modest salary for showing up one a week or once a month. This is, by my understanding (which includes a fair amount of firsthand evidence) the norm in large swathes of the world. No company could afford this level of inefficiency.\n\nDoctorow is using a Marxist terminology in his separation of capitalists from so-called feudalists. But even by the Marxian definition, capitalists are the owners of the means of production, which these people surely are -- I think Doctorow is simply manipulating his definition so as to cast aspersions. Tech company owners are operating as monopolists, if they can -- it is arguable that IP offers them the chance to be monopolists.

I will have to disagree again. The main economic agents of pre-capitalist economies were *people*: farmers, craftsmen, traders etc. The main economic agents of capitalist economies are companies, the great majority of which are for-profit. For-profit companies are greedy by statute; and have no equivalent in pre-capitalistic economies, as for-profit humans do not exist outside of psychopathology. Capitalism has the lion's share of greed. In fact, it proudly claims so, because it allegedly makes things more efficient. \n\n[quote=\"petussing, post:5, topic:18991\"]\nNo company could afford this level of inefficiency.\n[/quote]\n\nIn some contexts I have witnessed this can be interpreted as badly executed welfare. More efficient than having desperate people roving the streets, for sure. Designing and deploying an advanced welfare system would be better, but there is a capacity problem (like Ha-Joon Chang reminds us, it took western countries centuries to build the institutions that we would like developing countries to build in years).\n\nAnd don't get me started on the levels of inefficiency implied by, say, Uber. Or the American health care system. When you have the power, you don't need to be efficient: \"competition is for losers\", and everyone wants to graduate from mere capitalist to robber baron. It's just better for the bottom line. \n\n[quote=\"petussing, post:5, topic:18991\"]\ncapitalists are the owners of the means of production\n[/quote]\n\nHmm... no, my understanding is that capitalists are the owners of the means of production *in capitalism*. In feudalism, the lords own the means of production (the land). Godfrey inherited Bouillon and parts of Lorraine (prime real estate at the time) from his uncle, but that did not make him a capitalist! And even \"owning\", as in \"freehold owning\", is a modern, predominantly capitalistic concept. Godfrey was lord of the land, but in an important sense he was only holding on to it on behalf of Henry IV; and he would have promptly agreed that his title to the land came with responsibilities with respect to the people in it. He was not free, for example, to sell it, or destroy it.\n\nIn my reading, Doctorow is pointing out that a key tenet of capitalism in the Smith-Keynes-Hayek sense is euthanizing rentiers; and that, in the name of capitalism, the (especially American) \u00e9lites are bringing rentiers back.", "post_number": 6, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 18, "readers_count": 17, "incoming_link_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "like_count": 0, "score": 43.6, "reply_to_post_number": 5, "target_username": "petussing", "reply_to_post_id": 130375}, {"topic_id": 18991, "post_id": 130389, "username": "petussing", "user_id": 4640, "created_at": "2023-07-31T17:56:40.695Z", "raw": "Hi, Alberto-\n\nWe are getting to smaller but more recalcitrant disagreements...\n\nOn greed: there you are again -- the reflexive left desire to turn the Other/the Enemy (capitalists) into something non-human -- which in modern terms means subject to psychological pathology. I'm unconvinced. I know a lot of capitalists and hopefuls, and they are pretty human -- not pathological. I don't know a lot of Captains of Industry, or Captains of Shareholdership, so... maybe, but I would need much more compelling evidence. It worries me that you so often veer in the direction of fiction, and fiction critical of capitalism in particular -- yes, the film Wall Street proclaimed that Greed is Good. Milton Friedman was the single economist who came closest to that, but really this was showmanship too -- it made him into the conservatives' darling and the liberals' bete noir, and he reveled in both...\n\nGreed is a psychological pathology, as well as a Christian sin. To start, I don't mind mentioning that the left has a surprisingly strong Christian moralistic inclination that makes this sin probably the most important one -- I spend a fair amount of time criticizing the extent to which conversations about economics get derailed by theology. But actual businesses are supposed to be run in accordance with the need to control costs to become a better competitor, by enabling customers to get lower prices -- even in a monopoly this is not completely absent. But the left vastly overstates the case that the US, for example, is dominated by monopolies -- Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Meta are often offered as examples -- but of course these companies have competitors, and they are, as oligopolists, acutely aware of them. Amazon competes with Walmart at the highest level, as well as Target and even Alibaba globally; Apple competes with Samsung most obviously in cell phones, as well as Xiaomi (which is actually the world's largest smartphone manufacturer) and others; Alphabet's (Google's) biggest competitor is actually Meta (Facebook) -- the one is not a search company, nor the other social media as such -- they are both \"companies that sell advertising by providing information on customer activities\".\n\nLOL -- this is the first time I have seen anyone make the tortuous argument that the corruption of government department over-staffing is actually welfare! Family welfare, maybe...\n\nYes, I hate the US health care system, and definitely let's not get started on that one...\n\nMy take on Marx is that he was a sociologist and social reformer masquerading as an economist. His sociology was actually quite good -- this is why sociologists are the group of academics most inclined to still cite him; his economics-as-social-criticism less so. So when Marx refers to the feudal mode of production, he was not only referring to ownership, he was referring to an entire social setup that was not possible to disaggregate it into bits that could somehow be stuck into some other society. So, OK, \"ownership of the means of production\" refers to a feature of modern capitalist society -- but that is OK -- no, we have not somehow changed the nature of our society backward into a feudal one, no matter what Doctorow the non-economist, non-sociologist fiction writer says. Let's not even go there. It is purely rhetorical. Rhetoric is absolutely the field of fiction writers, especially those who are speculative, and Doctorow does it well (when he isn't swearing constantly, IMHO).\n\nYes, Adam Smith was an enemy of LAND rentiers. The best example of this, actually, is NOT Tesla or Meta, but Saudi Arabia and Nigeria and Mongolia and all the countries which are selling natural resources -- this is literal rent on an existing God-given natural resource, for which value is being reaped without labor of the same value being needed. But no -- Meta is reaping value from a couple of things, which are fascinating, but the understanding of which are impeded by Doctorow's rhetoric: 1. it demonstrates a \"new\"-ish Resource of Production, which is DATA -- data is information about how to design things as well as information on the activities and characteristics of economic actors; 2. IP, which is government-conferred \"temporary\" monopoly, in the form of patents and copyrights, which can have astronomical value; and 3. as I mentioned before, the clever extraction of both consumer and producer (and worker, to an extent) surplus for the benefit of workers.", "post_number": 7, "reply_count": 1, "reads": 18, "readers_count": 17, "incoming_link_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 28.6, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "alberto", "reply_to_post_id": 130332}, {"topic_id": 18991, "post_id": 130391, "username": "alberto", "user_id": 4, "created_at": "2023-07-31T23:26:44.811Z", "raw": "[quote=\"petussing, post:7, topic:18991\"]\nGreed is a psychological pathology, as well as a Christian sin.\n[/quote]\n\nI do not believe that. I do believe that healthy humans are not *exclusively*, and probably not even primarily, motivated by greed. I also know plenty of business owners (I am one myself!). They do not charge their children for hugs, or push their friends to the curbs if they do not come with power networks. In order to be solely motivated by greed you have to be non-human: the CEO of the fossil fuel company is not necessarily a sociopath, but his *role* is to act as a proxy for the company. The company is not a human, and \u2013 under the Maximizing Shareholder Value Doctrine \u2013 *is* a sociopath.

And please, let's skip \"it does not matter who has the initial endowment, as long as the markets are perfect\". It matters a lot, and the closer we get to human rights the more detrimental markets can be. In the 16th century, we had well-functioning markets for humans (slaves). Later, we acknowledged that was a bad idea. People having a right to life did not mean (in fact, excluded) that they could sell that life to others. I could wilfully sign a contract selling my kidney for money, but the law would nullify it. Privacy, autonomy, peace of mind are better thought of as human rights than as property rights.

In this sense they are welfare in the original functional sense: Bismarck, a German aristocrat who despised the masses, introduced a state pension system because he was convinced it would prevent a revolution. \n\n[quote=\"petussing, post:7, topic:18991\"]\nSo, OK, \u201cownership of the means of production\u201d refers to a feature of modern capitalist society \u2013 but that is OK \u2013 no, we have not somehow changed the nature of our society backward into a feudal one, no matter what Doctorow the non-economist, non-sociologist fiction writer says.\n[/quote]\n\nThis argument, Philip, looks circular to me. You refute Doctorow's idea that society has transitioned to a form of techno-feudalism by saying:\n\n1.

We engage with the arguments, not with the credentials of those making them. In passing, Doctorow has his own credentials used to be the chief editor of Boing Boing: he is on first name basis with all these tech moguls, and I dare say he knows tech business much better than I (maybe not than you). I find his argument intriguing, and there is a sense in which welfare is being destroyed by these companies, rather than created.

They were there as part of an initial phase of seeing how cars and trucks could fit into this new digital environment.  They spoke to me about their early drawing-board plans to harness the Internet in service of their company, knowing that soon enough the whole world would be connected that way.  At the time they spoke more about remote firmware upgrades as their motivation for having their vehicles \"phone home\" but it was clear that they were looking very broadly at opportunities.  Later I heard a Ford executive say they had become more of a finance company than a car company.\n\nFrom 2008-2015 I managed a radio station. Having come from a long career in digital communications, I was highly attuned to how the Internet and the airwaves might and might not intersect.  During those years I went to a lot of national meetups and discussed strategies with other station managers and executives of National Public Radio and other entities as to how this might all play out.\n\nAs you all probably know, the main use of radio is in vehicles...the good old car radio.  But with competition and tight margins, car companies have been looking for years for ways to cut costs and increase profits.  One cost item is the radio.  An AM-FM radio came standard in every car sold in America and probably most of Europe for decades.  Radio stations depend on that listenership for the great bulk of their financial support either through ads or direct contributions. So they pay a lot of attention to developments along these lines.\n\nBut car companies, that are now really more like finance companies, saw quite long ago that as consumers shifted towards getting info and entertainment through the 'Net, they would soon enough have a golden opportunity to turn a cost item - the radio - into a subscription-based Internet device. It meant that they could partner with the big phone companies to provide Internet-enabled communication devices for which they could get a monthly cut.  Now they all provide this and soon enough radios will be phased out. From cost item to profit center.  Sweet. For them.\n\nIt is no big stretch to see them applying that logic to other parts of the vehicle like battery power, seat heaters, etc.  Tesla has shown the way to this consumer-unfriendly promised land.\n\nSo, I say that regardless of what one might want to label things, Cory is correct about what is going on with cars and consumers.", "post_number": 10, "reply_count": 1, "reads": 10, "readers_count": 9, "incoming_link_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 37.0, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "alberto", "reply_to_post_id": 130332}, {"topic_id": 18991, "post_id": 132808, "username": "jcoate", "user_id": 6952, "created_at": "2023-11-29T22:58:42.931Z", "raw": "It is tied to DRM because if you don't want to participate in these rent-better-performance schemes, you have to fiddle with the software.", "post_number": 11, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 8, "readers_count": 7, "incoming_link_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 1.6, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "alberto", "reply_to_post_id": 130332}, {"topic_id": 18991, "post_id": 132824, "username": "bojanbobic", "user_id": 6658, "created_at": "2023-11-30T12:02:33.858Z", "raw": "@jcoate thank you for sharing your insightful perspective on the evolving automotive landscape.

He is even the subject of [a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow), so he is \u201cnotable\u201d! I take his opinions seriously.\n\nOn a first reading, though, I must say that [his piece on \u201cAutoenshittification\u201d](https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/) reads to me largely as a mash-up of his detailed reading of Yanis Varoufakis's \u201cTechnofeudalism\u201d along with a heavy dose of [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four).\n\nLet me first agree where I can agree. \n* Undoubtedly, the massive use of networked electronics in cars presents an opportunity for data to be extracted, whether openly or covertly, and used (annoyingly) for advertising and (potentially dangerously) for all kinds of surveillance, tracking, as Doctorow says.\n* To me, this puts cars in a similar category to mobile phones, which are routinely subject to potentially even more intrusive data collection \u2014 certainly not less.\n* Because cars are more expensive than mobile phones, there is probably more risk that they will be rented rather than bought; and the threat of repossession is more acute, meaning that owners of those kinds of car are more likely to be pressured into behaviour which would not otherwise be chosen.\n* IP is widely and unreasonably used to create the kind of artificial scarcity that fuels capitalism in general. (Whether it fuels rentier capitalism / technofeudalism is unclear to me.) This is why I am a keen supporter of free / open source software.\n* I enjoy and appreciate Varoufakis's analysis of what could have been called rentier capitalism being like a new form of feudalism, with digital fiefdoms. (I haven't actually read that book, but I have watched several related deep interviews with him.) Sadly, I haven't yet detached myself from the clutches of Google, but I hope that will come to pass in the not-too-distant future.\n\nI guess that's where we part company \u2014 not so much on the substance, but definitely on the tone. Doctorow states, with no evidence, that \u201cdrivers hate all the digital bullshit, from the janky touchscreens to the shitty, wildly insecure apps\u201d. I can well believe that he hates these things \u2013 even that his friends and the people he talks to also hate them \u2013 but to me his statement is basically unfounded. Many normal people enjoy these things.\n\nAnd while it's interesting to apply the Technofeudalism perspective to cars, is this really the most important aspect to focus on, for us modern Western consumers? It seems to me that Varoufakis puts more attention on the Google, Facebook, Amazon and their kin and counterparts in China. It would be a pity if the message to us abused consumers came across as: well you just have to buy dumb phones and second-hand cars and all will be well. That may appeal to people, and it's not a bad idea, but still, I would prefer to see a more radical, as well as practically effective approach. After all, when we're dealing with carbon emissions, I find it very awkward to be focusing on switching the lights off when you're not in the room. As if that makes a big difference \u2026 for sure, turn them off anyway, but don't imagine that that's going to solve the problem.\n\nIt's not clear to me, but my impression is that Varoufakis is short on plausible solutions. It is clear that Doctorow, here, is not giving us any positive way forward \u2014 at least, beyond the doubtfully effective \u201cjust say no\u201d. And that to me is a real issue. It seems like Doctorow, perhaps (I speculate here) driven by the agenda of his own persona, is playing along the same lines as many other writers who play to the audience perversely receptive to the message \u201cwe're all going to hell\u201d. Worse, I can see conspiracy theorists picking this up and exaggerating it to give the impression that digital technology is all bad. For sure, a lot of the ways it is applied are bad, but exaggeration simply reinforces polarisation, which is itself part of the wider social problem. \n\nI appreciate measured and reasonable analyses, seeing different perspectives and understanding the motivations and drivers behind these different perspectives; and particularly when they are allied with calls to practical, accessible actions that we can take to make a real impression on the problems highlighted, while recognising and valuing the other related perspectives underlying the many other initiatives that are pointing in the right general direction.

DRM is one of those themes.  When he and I worked together at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (2002-3) he had fewer arenas of digital tech to cite as examples. Back then he focused on certain printers that would not work if you tried to resupply them with third-party ink.  \n\nThen, with Apple and later John Deere (the tractor company), he expanded to advocate for the right-to-repair.  This has gained traction in the USA.  California just passed a right-to-repair law, becoming the third state to do so.  There is no doubt in my mind that Cory has influenced this trend.\n\nAnd I also suspect there is a tone of despair in his latest campaign against \"enshittification.\"  I must admit I share that feeling.  We all know where the planet and its degrading climate is headed.  Doesn't seem to matter enough to enough people.  But then, it's the human race. Twas ever thus.\n\nAs for how the EU might treat this situation when it comes to vehicles, there is some built-in tension with the EU being strong on personal privacy and equally, if not more, strong on DRM protections for companies.  I'm not sure how this knife-edge will be walked.\n\nAs for how consumers regard the electronics in their new cars, I agree that not everyone \"hates\" these features.

Between the lines I read it as a text telling a story about a society where the people who experience the consequences of unregulated development in products and services have retreated from the field of (party) politics.\nThus these people have left the debate and the lawmaking and regulation process with a walkover. \n\nI also don't find the text a very engaging read the way it's written. I wound find it more engaging and intriguing the way that the authors novels are written. I do like several of the authors fictional text but can understand those who get tired of reading this, a collection of bad news written in a long rant. I would have found it very much a source for engagement and action if it would have been formulated in a way like a guide \"multiple ways to combat and regulate anti-consumer practices\".

I think it is important and it has been fruitful as the new EU laws have been signed - which is only one step in the right direction.\n\n> In a leap forward, the new law supports independent repair and improves consumers\u2019 access to affordable repair options, by introducing **rules for reasonable prices for original parts** as well as **banning software practices which prevent independent repair and the use of compatible and reused spare parts**. Campaigners applaud this as a step in the right direction for affordable repair.\n\nhttps://repair.eu/news/new-eu-law-sets-to-make-repair-more-affordable-for-selected-products-campaigners-push-for-widespread-right-to-repair/", "post_number": 29, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 4, "readers_count": 3, "incoming_link_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 15.8, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "alberto", "reply_to_post_id": 130332}], "18042": [{"topic_id": 18042, "post_id": 119729, "username": "inge", "user_id": 1856, "created_at": "2022-11-16T05:41:38.153Z", "raw": "![image|690x388](upload://ysyHcfN7nQdiehUwyivOdtOotTD.jpeg)\n*Illustration by Inge Snip*\n\nOne of the problems of the car industry is overproduction. This is also why cars are thrown away after 15 years because cars are pushed into the system at the front, making them prematurely obsolete, and therefore people get rid of them.\n\nWhere do those economies of scale come from? It depends on the technology that the car industry uses that forces the economies of scale: the all-steel body. Cars consist of basically a welded steel box. That is where the high investment is.\n\nThe problem is that it\u2019s such a capital-intensive technology it forces economies of scale. As a result, a modern car plant\u2019s break-even point for a mass-produced model is between 180,000 and 200,000 a year. They lose money when they fall below that unless they are a specialist producer. Their only option is to produce at that level and then sell.\n\nIf you get rid of that technology, can you then go for lower economies of scale and not be forced to produce in those high volumes?\n\n**Alternative business model** \nBased on low-volume manufacturers, a fracturing localised to its market, and combine it with a sales and maintenance model: a micro factory retail. In this small industrial units assemble cars, and customers buy straight from those assembly facilities. They can specify the vehicle to their needs, and local suppliers can feed into it.\n\nIf demand for new cars declines, the company can deal with maintenance, repair, upgrading, and recycling. \n\nExamples:\n\n* The company Simple, based in Wales. Although being a small business, they\u2019re swamped. They've developed a small hydrogen fuel cell car, building a fleet of 50 cars that will be placed with people in the local area. Their business model is based on a kind of leasing, a product service system. You lease the car, and then the company takes them back and reconfigures them for the next customer. They do all the repair and maintenance that\u2019s needed. One of their arguments was that when you look at the fuel cell cars that the industry has, they are mainly large American cars. But what if you can get small off-the-shelf fuel cells for next to nothing. The entire car is much cheaper by configuring a very lightweight small car around that.\n\n* Gordon Murray designed the first carbon fibre monocoque Formula One car and a road car, the McLaren F1, which is supposed to be the best supercar ever made. Murray decided around 2000 he wanted to venture into environmental car design. His model is that he develops concepts, including the manufacturing concept. The product can then be placed around the world. You would have a network of factories.\n\nNot everybody needs to do the design.

Spare parts would be around 4.50 EUR even if the bulb, wire and fuse would all be broken at the same time. But we live in modern times. Now the spare was around 450 EUR (and 150 EUR for testing and repair) for a little black box (literally black) answering to the name of 3C8937049AC that was at fault ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/kostenvoranschlag-reparatur-nebellampe-600-euro-t5619131.html#post46481361), German). Didn\u2019t car lamps work just fine with wires, bulbs and fuses in times past? What exactly does this black box with electronics (\u201cECU\u201d) *do*, except breaking down?\n\nAnother person\u2019s **headlights** failed. Since these were xenon lights, they were a bit, umh, complex. The lamps themselves plus their companion black boxes with electronics had to be replaced. The cost? 950 EUR ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html?page=1#post58932980)).\n\n\n### Instruments, sensors, everything really\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![image|628x316, 75%](upload://lOwCYk408gvGp4uiGl7uxlxwviq.jpeg) \n\nDo your automotive instrument issues cause you nightmares?

His dash instruments were acting up and the whole car was **not running properly** anymore ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html#post58929386)) \u2026 the engine had very little power output, was not taking accelerator input properly, and the brake was not working. (Turns out, the brake issue was \u201conly\u201d because the engine was silently dying while driving so that the engine-supported brake did not brake properly anymore ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html#post58930037)) \u2013 umh, how comforting that the brake still worked but only *appeared* to not work.) Anyway, not drivable anymore, and the official repair shop could not find any issue ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html?page=1#post58936146)) (in other words, they were overwhelmed by this problem). Anyway, 160 forum messages later they had figured out this issue together ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html?page=10#post59025422)). And the culprit was: a defective crankshaft position sensor. These defects do not show up in the self-diagnosis system of the vehicle electronics as the vehicle has no way to check the plausibility of the sensor values, but apparently their malfunction is the only sensor malfunction that can cause the engine switch off ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html?page=11#post59030424)). Spare part cost for the sensor was just 40 EUR ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html?page=11#post59030115)). The cost of figuring out the problem, if paid at commercial rates, had probably been 100 times that. Add to that the multiple parts that repair shops usually replace while looking for the issue ([example](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/staendig-elektronik-probleme-t6848134.html?page=1#post58932766), for the same symptoms) and it amounts to a total economic loss of the vehicle due to \u2026 a part that sells for 40 EUR here and is manufactured for maybe 5 EUR by our industrious Chinese friends. If that does not cause you nightmares, you\u2019re living too long on this planet already! :laughing:\n\nReports of electronics failure can be so unexplainable that we should accept the \u201c**ghost in a machine**\u201d hypothesis as the most likely. Or how do you explain *this*?\n\n> A long time ago, for example, I had a Lada Samara. Its engine always went out at a certain traffic light on my way to work when the traffic light was green. The engine only started again as soon as the traffic light showed red again. So, it was bad luck when I had to stop at this traffic light of all places. There were always few funny horn companies from the following motorists. My car workshop told me I\u2019m crazy when I described the issue. But when I let the workshop foreman come along for a demonstration, they stopped laughing. ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/steuergeraet-defekt-oder-abzockversuch-t2535192.html#post23035866), translated to English)\n\nOh, and I have **one more** like that, my personal favourite. A friend\u2019s brother whose VW Touran diesel car did not start anymore. None of several workshops could figure it out, so he asked my friend to just sell it as broken. My friend takes it to his place but does not want to give up on it so easily. But can\u2019t figure it out either. So he just leans on the car and prays for it. From right then and there, it started reliably again. They still sold it shortly afterwards, because, who knows how long that treatment lasts.\n\nEven **battle tanks**, the most indestructible of all vehicles, are easily taken out of action nowadays by pulling on a cable or other electrical component. When I was in the military, I found a damage report in our tank unit of [Leopard 2A5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2#Leopard_2A5) main battle tanks. Somebody had stepped on something wrong upon leaving the tank through the turret hatch, and that broke one of the tank\u2019s electronics boards. Repair costs were roughly 10,000 EUR in today\u2019s money (I don\u2019t remember exactly).\n\n\n## 2. The Appropriate Car\n\nAppropriate technology is about \u201ctechnological choice and application that is small-scale, affordable \\[\u2026\\], decentralized, \\[\u2026\\] energy-efficient, environmentally sound, and locally autonomous \\[\u2026\\] The term appropriate technology is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society, i.e., technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate.\u201d ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology); leaving out \u201clabor-intensive\u201d because that\u2019s about job creation, not the use of technology).\n\nWell, *sweet!* If that isn\u2019t what we want from technology, I don\u2019t know. Those modern, electronic-filled, automobile shaped nightmares from above are however quite far off the mark. With all their absurdly cushioning comfort, they even fail in providing us with valuable human experience, as we shall see in a later piece. In other words, there is a good amount (but not complete) overlap between less wasteful car electronics and what car users need and sometimes demand.\n\nBut just how became cars such a nightmare? That\u2019s a good question (and you\u2019re welcome to join the discussion below). Here\u2019s a very limited, mechanistic perspective: since new cars still last three years before the maintenance and repair nightmares begin, this fragile technology does not cause nightmares to the immediate, paying customers: those purchasing or leasing new cars, and switching them for another new one after one to a few years. Cars are made as impressive high-tech packages that last these first few years, often sold or rather leased as a mobile booster for social status, and directly fund automakers in that role. After that, automakers do not care, beyond making a mint of money from excessively priced spare parts and repairs. Second-hand owners care, though. The environment cares. Future people care about the wasteful practices of today.\n\nThat brings us to another good question: what can be done. I\u2019ll start with a few ideas what can be done with technology alone, and you\u2019re very welcome to expand on that and also to add policy, sociological, business and metaphysical perspectives in the discussion below:\n\n1.  **Reduce.** The first commandment in \u201cReduce, reuse, recycle\u201d. What is not there cannot break. All the electronics in optional extras are not necessary, otherwise these would not be called \u201coptions\u201d. Similarly, many separate electronic devices can be merged into a universal one, as demonstrated by smartphones and their apps, and as also demonstrated by the \u201csingle large screen\u201d user interface of Tesla\u2019s cars.\n\n2.  **Learning from repairs.** There are already a few companies that offer to repair automotive electronic units, for 15-30% of an original new spare part. When doing the repairs is when you learn how your products break. It\u2019s also much more environmentally friendly than just replacing one piece of electronic junk with another, which is how cars create issues of electronic waste during their lifetime. So, manufacturers should be doing the repairs themselves, and somehow have the incentives to improve their products from what they learn. A lifelong \u201cright to have it repaired\u201d might help: as a customer, you\u2019d still have to figure out which part is broken, but then getting it repaired would be free of charge.\n\n3.  **Constant evolution, not fast fashion.** New passenger cars are positioned as lifestyle products that follow fashion trends paced in model years and distinguished by design and luxury features. Such an environment eliminates the benefits of learning from previous failures: every switch to a new model translates to hundreds of changes, so that learnings can not be applied unmodified. And of course, all these changes introduce more weaknesses as well. Beyond a certain rate of change, learnings from previous failures are worth very little. What we need is car models that are built for decades in a kind of slow evolution. The emergence of luxury and vanity features indicates a certain maturity in the development of a product\u2019s core functionality. Of course, with the switch to electric cars we will have another few years of fast advancing technology, but after that, it\u2019s the right time for a constant evolution towards reliable and appropriate technology.\n\n4.  **Redundancy.** Automakers sometimes use a single level of redundancy, as employed or at least proposed by Tesla for data cable wiring ([source](https://electrek.co/2019/08/19/tesla-wiring-redundancy-self-driving/)) and used by Tesla for their self-driving control computers ([source](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-hw3-autopilot-dual-redundancy-activated/)). However, that is for operational safety: the vehicle will not fail immediately, and the redundant system can be used until the failed part is repaired in the near future. But with more than one level of redundancy, it would actually be acceptable for a part to fail, without the car requiring a repair of this part in its lifetime. Note also how redundant sensors allow to detect a sensor fault by comparing their values \u2013 a good strategy to avoid cases like that of the faulty crankshaft sensor from above, which did not and could not show up in the self-diagnosis system as there was no way to cross-check its values.\n\n5.  **Expert systems for failure diagnoses.** I quite like the idea of failure self-diagnosis, as already implemented in cars. But not the way it is implemented. The first issue: display the actual meaning of current error codes on a screen in the car\u2019s main digital screen. That\u2019s empowering the users; otherwise, we\u2019re forced to empower ourselves by buying Chinese and Russian reverse-engineered diagnostic devices. The second issue: no self-diagnosis system will ever be perfect, even with redundancy, as failures are by nature unpredictable. Currently, \u201cdiagnosis\u201d then happens by exchanging *possibly* defective parts, paid for by the car owner, until the actually defective one has been isolated. That is wasteful, and can be improved by an expert system in which everyone doing car repairs can enter their repair results in a structured way. It\u2019s for providing repair advice like an Internet forum now, only better.\n\n6.  **Longevity requirements.** One point that wades into policy realm. I don\u2019t get how policy makers care about [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_emission_standards)[ver-stricter e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_emission_standards)[mission regulation for cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_emission_standards), but not about the wastage of critical raw materials and of energy by short lifetimes of cars and car parts, especially electronic ones. A car, including its electronics, that lasts five times as long has an 80% lower resource consumption of all raw materials even in the absence of recycling. And such a lifetime is not unrealistic, as demonstrated by commercial trucks. Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk is on record for saying that \u201cModel 3 drive unit and body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life.\u201d ([source](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117099861273219073)). Even in case the average Tesla Model 3 cannot live up to that \u2013 this is the direction to go, and this is what policy makers must tell automakers so they will tell their engineers. The price for a new vehicle may rise, but the resale price will also be higher \u2013 so first-hand owners will not care, and second-hand owners will be thankful for a more reliable vehicle.\n\nThat\u2019s enough of tech proposals, because surely better tech alone will not get us out of this nightmare. It rather seems to me that the whole value system of our current culture is at fault, enabling such a poor creation and experience as that of today\u2019s cars. I leave you with a quote from \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\u201d for now (actually the most-sold philosophy book of all time). We can explore the implications on cars together.\n\n> \u201c\\[J\\]ust *stare* at the machine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Just live with it for a while. Watch it the way you watch a line when fishing and before long, as sure as you live, you\u2019ll get a little nibble, a little fact asking in a timid, humble way if you\u2019re interested in it.

There are so many things to say that I do not know where to start. :slight_smile:\n\nI'll start with this: vehicle longevity is certainly a super important factor in choosing your ride. I have been a motorcyclist for 25 years, and for 22 of those years I have ridden BMWs, which have a reputation for being indestructible. Back when I started, there was a rumor that \"80% of all BMW bikes *ever produced* are still on the road\". That was probably a myth, but it was true that those machines were very reliable. Few people can \"finish off\" the engine of a BMW bike. Most motorcyclists ride only on weekends, fewer than 5,000 kms a year, and at that pace you could probably buy a BMW bike at 30 and ride it until you are 70. You, could, in fact, ride just the one good bike for your entire life.\n\nPart of this longevity was the policy of keeping spare parts on the catalog for a long, long time. But, as electronics crept into the motorcycle world, I am not sure how they are going to keep doing that. Also, they now have to maintain the maintenance systems themselves: mechanics \u2013 even the very experienced ones \u2013 are now powerless without the (proprietary) software diagnostic tools, produced and maintained by the manufacturer. Will those tools still be maintained and backward-compatible? How long? Will mechanics in 2037 be able to look into the electronics of a 2005 bike?", "post_number": 2, "reply_count": 1, "reads": 24, "readers_count": 23, "incoming_link_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 49.8, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "matthias", "reply_to_post_id": 100017}, {"topic_id": 16279, "post_id": 100042, "username": "matthias", "user_id": 5, "created_at": "2021-10-08T10:56:51.416Z", "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:16279\"]Part of this longevity was the policy of keeping spare parts on the catalog for a long, long time.[/quote]\n\nAh yes, of course! Spare parts availability is a great additional point. A closely related point that I should have mentioned in the list of possible improvements at the end of the article is: standardization. There's just no better enabler of technological efficiency (and thus also, resource efficiency and resource protection) than standardization. If the most needed spare parts are all standard parts, manufacturers do not even have to care about stocking them. Like, how a few weeks ago I was able to buy steering rod dust caps for my 43 y/o oldtimer truck by buying new ones made for agricultural tractors. Measures had been standardized and were still the same after all that time.\n\nSadly, technology and especially automotive technology is moving away from standardized parts. They are not even standardized in the same vehicle anymore, due to all the unnecessary variants that one can order. In the story of the fog light repair related above, there had been 12 different variants of the broken onboard electricity control unit (another black box with electronics \u2026) *for the same model of car* ([source](https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/kostenvoranschlag-reparatur-nebellampe-600-euro-t5619131.html?page=2#post46642378)).

A few days ago I spoke to a client of mine, an elderly German man who has been driving many different cars for decades, including expensive ones. I asked for stories about nightmare defects and repairs, and got these ones:\n\n**A birth defect.** The client's new 2021 Suzuki Jimny had a \"birth defect\": the right mirror sometimes would not automatically fold to the car when closing the door. Not that this is a critical function to start with, but when you have a new car you probably want it to work. The dealer says, bend it to the car manually, and then it will work again. It did, for about five times. So the client brought the car do the dealer and demands it gets fixed, and to get a rental car if needed to bridge the time. Situation is pending. Lots of time and money lost for something that nobody really needs. Five mechanical spare mirrors will still be cheaper than a single electronic one.\n\n**A suicidal jeep.** The same Suzuki Jimny has an active lane guard system, or let's say, suicidal tendencies. That system actively overrides your steering to keep you on the road. Now a certain left turn in a forest outside the client's village *always* scares that lane guard system. As a result, the car wants to go off the road into the forest, and the client has to use some force on the steering wheel to keep it on the road. Now that lane guard system can be disabled manually after starting the car, but ever so often the client would forget it, drive through the same curve, and nearly veer off the road *again*. So the client asks the dealer's workshop to disable this feature at engine start as a default, and they say: sorry, that's impossible.\n\n**Washing a car key.** The client's wife once put a car key in the washing machine by accident, and afterwards it was broken. We joked that car keys were washable alright in old times. Well, the new electronic car key fob did cost the client ca. 200 EUR, and the workshop got another 150-200 EUR for \"training\" it to match the car.\n\n**How many Germans to change a lightbulb?** The original lightbulb joke about Germans answered \"One, we're very efficient but not funny.\" ([source](**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbulb_joke)). But that's a matter of the past. Case in question, the client was driving an unspecified car on the highway in Germany when one frontlight bulb stopped working. Client visits a highway fuel station that fortunately has a workshop, and agrees with the mechanic to wait in the restaurant until the bulb is fixed. After some time, the mechanic appears and says: \"Sorry I can't change that bulb, in this car model it needs a specialized tool. We have to call ADAC roadside assistance.\" They got it done finally. But how many Germans was that?\n\n1. mechanic\n2. client waiting in the restaurant\n3. ADAC dispatch agent\n4. ADAC roadside assistance crew\n5. company manufacturing the special tool that ADAC had (let's say that's 20 Chinese)\n6. workers in a worldwide logistics system to bring in that special tool\n7. everyone who contributed to building and operating the mobile phone network that was used to call in the ADAC reinforcements\n\nHow many Germans is that?

We often take hitch hikers from down to the next village over, they only recently paved the road between our two villages. \n![Untitled design - 2022-03-29T101750.036|690x690](upload://AoDdoPs3V24lnNkQx7ocInBCaxp.jpeg)\n\n\nOur road, a dead end road connecting to the main road, isn't paved. The only two roads paved are the main roads, with one of them paid for by the local government and the other by the community. For some reason, instead of the more expensive four wheel drives that can handle this kind of environment better, most cars are 20 year old sedans, with Mercedes being a local fav. \n\nNow, many cars on the road here are cars that have been written off in the EU or in the US. Funny side note: my father-in-law owns a car import company from the US. They buy - or private people and dealers through them - cars from the states with significant electronic and/or mechanical damages/issues, fix them up, and resell them regionally (incl to Armenia and Azerbaijan). \n\nYou'd think that would mean there's a lot of knowledge and car parts. Well, yes and no. If you own a \"popular\" brand (Mercedes, BMW or Toyota) there is more knowledge and there are parts. Try finding a replacement part for a Volvo, Citroen or Mazda, good luck.... \n\nBut no matter the brand, you yourself will still be stuck for a day or more looking for parts yourself asking around who may have x part for 200X car in unmarked garages off highways, with some mechanics taking you to another unmarked garage in a residential area locked with a large lock, car parts everywhere, but yes, going through the chaos that find that tiny little specific part eventually. \n\nNow with all of these particularities combined, we (my partner and I) had to become creative and inventive as car owners. Here are some of my fav anecdotes:\n\n- Our second car (I wont even talk about the first I owned, a Mitsubishi Pajero, I will never get one of those again) was a 2003 Nissan XTerra that we had bought through my father-in-law's company. There was one issue: the check engine light was almost always on. But they couldn't find anything wrong. The solution: just ignore. \nWell, of course there was something wrong. Or many things. \nOne day, our car had troubles starting. We had it checked, but they couldn't find anything. Next time it happened we were up at our house. Towing would be incredibly expensive. So, we went online and tried figuring out if we could fix it. Turns out, with the specific make and model (and some other cars as well), **hitting the starter with a hammer** as you attempt to start will help. AND IT DID. \n![Untitled design - 2022-03-29T101744.035|690x690](upload://pImTXcpX5OnyorGjqmrxkrZ472g.jpeg)\n\nThe third time it happened we were yet again at our house. This time, the hammer did not solve it. So we decided to take the starter out of the car ourselves, completely disassemble it, trying to find the issue (which we did) and reassemble it. \n![Untitled design - 2022-03-29T101758.994|690x690](upload://lRk1okZJhr85igpY6We7mvEyXJG.jpeg)\n\n* My father-in-law felt bad about the troubles we were having with the car and decided to give us the car of his father (as he wasn't using it), a 2004 Nissan Xterra. Within a month of owning it, the transmission broke. It cost us $2000 to fix it as it's such a specific job and you need specialized expensive Nissan-rated tools for it. But, in the states, or the EU it would've cost us over $10,000 likely. And it would've likely been written off.\n- Now a couple of years later we also started using my grandmother-in-law's city car, a 2006 Hyundai with no luxuries accept for the AC. A manual car, not automatic as our Xterras had been. And boy, this car did great. Untill a couple of months ago. A weird sound started coming out of the engine when driving, especially with AC on. A temp solution was turning the car on and off, and the sound would be gone. We bickered about the issue. I said it was AC-related, my partner thought it was a loose bolt. Two days ago the engine died while my partner was driving away from the house. He and a neighbor figured out that it was indeed the AC's compressor. They disconnected the belt: the sound is gone, the car drives smoothly, and is much more economical. We don't have a working AC, but that's ok!\n\nAs you can read from my experiences, I related a lot with what you wrote about issues and possible solutions. From reducing \"luxuries\", to pushing for interchangeable car parts across brands and models, and learning from repairs (the reason I never want a Mitshubishi Pajero again is that the car constantly needed a specific fixing, I forgot what it was as it was over a decade ago, which was a known issue for that specific type of car....), to constant evolution - I'll explain last part below.  \n\nLast winter/spring, our beloved 2004 Xterra died. Well, the engine did. The only option was to pay yet again $2000 to fix it/replace it. And we decided to sell the car to a mechanic instead, who was planning to use it for its parts.\n\nSo, we have been driving our tiny city car on unpaved mountain roads. It was doing extremely well, even on ice and in the snow, we had this winter. Until it started snowing three weeks ago and didn't stop. \n![IMG_20220325_152657|690x511](upload://e7DuaAaCGKxwfLOQyc51rSH5snH.jpeg)\n\nMy father-in-law, a good man, offered to get us a new car that can handle the kind of environment we sometimes find ourselves in (this kind of snow we are seeing right now is a rarity, but with climate change, who knows....). \n\nAnd this brings me to your point of constant evolution and not fast fashion because the model we are eyeing (a Toyota 4runner) has had the same engine model for over a decade, which is a rarity in car design. The reason: it's a good reliable engine, why change something that is good? Most cars change engine design every couple of years. \n\nAnother reason we're eyeing the model is due to the easiness to fix something. Many of the modern cars we see today have everything so cramped into the engine base that if you'd want to fix something you'd have to remove the engine by hauling it out completely (like with the newer Subarus).  Most Toyotas make it easier for DIY at-home repairs. \n\nWe haven't found \"the one\" yet, because as I mentioned earlier most cars here have been in accidents of some kind before being fixed up and you don't want to accidentally lose a wheel breaking the chassis going over a bump - we check the VIN number of any car we're interested in to see previous damages and fix-ups to see how crucial the damages were and how reliably it could have been fixed. There's one car that will be fixed up that week that seems to be fitting our needs and wasn't damaged that badly, so fingers crossed we'll be able to get out of this snow soon ;).", "post_number": 9, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 14, "readers_count": 13, "incoming_link_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 72.8, "reply_to_post_number": 5, "target_username": "matthias", "reply_to_post_id": 103645}, {"topic_id": 16279, "post_id": 105624, "username": "Asahi_Bushi", "user_id": 7683, "created_at": "2022-05-04T10:26:27.203Z", "raw": "It\u2019s really refreshing to read something as lucid as this instead of the seemingly ubiquitous \u201cnew is better, tech will save us\u201d point of view that dominates most discussions about automobiles.

It\u2019s not just repair costs or breakdown woes: our economies are based on oil and minerals, our cities are built around streets for cars, a significant part of our lifetimes is spent in traffic jams or working towards paying the next installment for that four-wheel luxury object we bought to keep up with the Joneses. That\u2019s what I loved about this article, it realizes these connections and understands that a more genuine approach to car ownership is key to economical and environmental sustainability: it\u2019s not what we buy, it\u2019s how we relate to what we buy through our ownership.\n\nSadly, from my experience in automotive journalism, I think this perspective is rarely considered. It\u2019s all about what\u2019s new, what can be sold to the customer regardless of how soon it\u2019ll become obsolete or how genuinely useless it is. Maybe I\u2019m a bit of a luddite, to me a car only needs four tires, a seat, a radio, and a decent power-to-weight ratio; but why we cannot have a middle ground between a barebones racecar and a mansion on wheels with 500 kilograms of soon-to-be-outdated wiring and semiconductors? Profit? Consumerism? Are we really getting the cars we want and need or are we buying what the auto industry has made us believe we want and need? And on the topic of power-to-weight ratios, if we care so much about engineering efficiency and environmental sustainability, why do we still ignore this critical metric that has defined some of history\u2019s most beloved cars? \n\nThere\u2019s also the topic of safety: everyone wants a safe car, but people rarely care about being safe drivers. I get the feeling it\u2019s because they don\u2019t really care about driving that much, to most people driving is just another menial task like washing the dishes or buying groceries. And I guess that\u2019s the crux of the matter: that flawed value system of our current culture which you mention.

The new owner is even listening to the American guy's Spotify playlist, because, of course, the car knows the login information. This is a bit of a problem, because the business model of the car industry is more and more based on value extraction by unlocking, via software, premium functionalities ([see](https://edgeryders.eu/t/automotive-nightmares-part-2-from-cory-doctorow/18991?u=alberto)). So, the new owner in Ukraine could in some scenarios purchase functionalities that would be charged to the old owner. \n\nThe Tesla app comes with a functionality to remove vehicles from your account, but to do that you need to know the information about the new owner.

So, on the 100 km, hybrid consumption is 5 litre, and EURO 5 old brother 4 l per 100 km.  The price of the hybrid was two times higher in comparison with the EURO 5 brother.. I got a much slower new car than the older brother, with more than double lower km range (the older one had almost 1000 km range with a full tank, and the younger hybrid about 400 km ). The only difference with the older EURO 5 brother was in electronics, which I'm not using because the wi-fi connection with my smartphone and other electronic support only disturbs my driving.

But what happens when new technologies and materials are introduced? What kind of circular economy loop would work with cars? And would the circular economy discourage innovating? \n\n**Materials**\nThe steel from which most cars are made is very recyclable. But if you build a circular economy system around that, it assumes cars are made of steel.\n\n* The Renault Espace has essentially galvanised steel framework onto which there are plastic panels. It\u2019s a hybrid technology. Audi\u2019s Jaguar also makes largely aluminium cars. A lot of companies now make aluminium cars. Aluminium is also recyclable, so you need to find demand for steel and aluminium.\n\n* Then you get technologies like the BMW i3. It\u2019s built on an aluminum platform and has a carbon fibre superstructure. You can only grind carbon fibre down and use the powder you get as a filler for other products. But a structure like that of the BMW i3 should last 40 or 50 years without too many problems. So you get all those trade-offs.\n\n* We\u2019re in the middle of transitioning from internal combustion engines to electric motors. You can melt internal combustion engines down and turn them into new castings either out of cast iron or aluminium, but do you necessarily have a demand for whatever it produces?\n\n**How do we understand your circular economy?** \nWhat would work for cars? Are we looking at the circularity within one product, within one product, one in one industry, within one sector, within a locality, and within a region?\n\n* Close-loop homes in reuse and recycling. But what about reducing?\n\n* Are material innovations discouraged? Lithium, for example, is a classic with lithium batteries. But if you change the battery technology to another one, what do you do with all the waste lithium from the older batteries? From the current crop of cars? How do you accommodate that?\n\n* What area would the loop operate in? A closed loop needs to be more specific as to whether the loop should be closed within a single product type, e.g. mobile phones, computers, or cars. Or within one sector? e.g., construction or within one economy.

My son-in-law works for the local water district as a specialist on the health of the fish in the rivers.  I asked him recently what the major pollutant of the rivers is, expecting something like chemical runoff from sewers.  But he said \"car tires.\"\n\nWe all know that tires wear down as they accumulate miles.  Bit by bit that tread comes off on the roadway until they get replaced.  And that tread goes into the sewers and straight into the waterways, carrying all sorts of fairly exotic chemicals such as cadmium.\n\nThe good news is that tires do get recycled.  But globally, there are over 1.6 billion new tires and one billion end-of-life waste tires generated each year. However, the recycling industry processes only 100 million tires every year.\n\nRecycled tires convert into fuel, rubberized asphalt, flooring, turf and railroad ties.\n\nAccoring to an industry publication, \"tire makers are increasing their commitment to recycling. Tire makers are looking into changing up the mix of materials in their products, to increase recyclable and renewable ingredients. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Bridgestone and Continental have announced intentions to use certain percentages of sustainable and renewable materials in their tires.\n\nGoodyear said it planned to sell a tire to the consumer market with 'up to 70% sustainable-material content' this year. The company also announced that it had produced a demonstration tire comprising '90% sustainable materials,' Chris Helsel, senior vice president of global operations and chief technology officer, said in a statement, adding that the company is making progress toward introducing 'a 100% sustainable-material tire\u201d'by 2030.\n\nBridgestone set a commitment to increase the use of recycled and renewable materials to 40% by 2030; and seeks to have 100% sustainable materials by 2050, according to Sarah Amick of USTMA. Michelin has set a goal to achieve 100% sustainable materials by 2050.\n\nBut like so many recycling efforts, it's not enough.  But again, if there is good news it is that recycling is gaining ground.  \n\nFrom the same industry report, \"A  recent U.S. Scrap Tire Management Report showed that in 2021 about 71% of scrap tires were delivered to end-use markets.\n\nTire industry experts contend that expanding the markets for materials recycled from scrap tires will be an ongoing effort. \n\nThe recycling market \u201cunfortunately has been not growing enough, and we are seeing more scrap tires going to landfill as a result.\u201d\n\nA separate challenge is scrap tires in illegal or abandoned stockpiles. In 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated there were over 1 billion scrap tires at such sites. Fewer than 50 million remained in such locations in 2021, according to the USTMA report, a reduction of more than 95%. \n\nSources:\nhttps://autoily.com/how-are-tires-recycled/\n\nhttps://www.ttnews.com/articles/tire-sustainability-remains-top-priority-industry", "post_number": 3, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 11, "readers_count": 10, "incoming_link_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 37.2, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "inge", "reply_to_post_id": 119723}, {"topic_id": 18039, "post_id": 136485, "username": "Maurinho", "user_id": 8265, "created_at": "2024-01-08T17:16:56.581Z", "raw": "So true!

So this is one example in metal recycling, there are many others because metal has a value. And if you think about a car or if you think about UBC's used beverage cans, for example, if the collection system works, you can infinitely recycle them. The same you can do with cars. When they are shredded. You can extract the aluminium, for example, out of the stream, the ferris, all of the all of the metals.

Good. So I call it the car industrial complex, how it works and why. But a bit about me. I think Inga has said a few things, but for the last 35 years or so, I've been trying to reconcile being both a petrolhead and a tree hugger, as they call it here. So I love cars, but I also like to think of myself as a bit of an environmentalist. I now call myself an independent automotive philosopher. There are not many people who think about the industry, and the industry is full of doers rather than thinkers. So that's important. But I used to be a singer pointed out. I used to be a senior lecturer in logistics and operations management at Cardiff University here in Wales, specifically at Cardiff Business School, and I was co director for the Center for Automotive Industry Research, but also at the Electric Vehicle Centre of Excellence. I was also an associate of the Sustainable Places Research Centre Research Institute here in Cardiff and the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, which you may have come across. So here is me next to a Formula One car, right? Cars and our environment. Now, for many of our mentors, and this is how I started off as well, it's very tempting to assume cars can be invented. I say, Why don't we get rid of all cars and everybody cycles and things like that? But that's really unrealistic that I call it a quixotic quest.\n\nIt's not going to happen. So what can we do instead? So I spent with a number of colleagues many years starting to see how we can accommodate both the car system and the needs for for environmental optimization. One of the things we can obviously consider is making fewer cars and also making different sorts of cars. So here's the structure I've got. I've sort of bounced off here. First, something about the car industry, how it works, then about its environmental impact. Then how people relate to cars, and then finally a section about the future, how it's likely to pan out. So first, the car industry, how it works and why. Now, mass production was. Not inevitable. History could have taken us in various different directions. Mass production, of course, had precedent in other sectors like guns and meat processing and things like that. And applying it to cars was actually quite tricky. And it was done in the US because they perceived a potential massive increase in demand for cars and this is usually credited to Henry Ford. Now here the picture here is a Ford Model T coming off the production line at Highland Park. And this is essentially it coming off the Ford production line. This is what Ford made. And this is an important point. Ford did not make bodies at Highland Park, but a model T was made bodies were outsourced to around 50 different coach builders because they couldn't work out how to mass produce car bodies.\n\nSo all those 15 million Model T's used a separate chassis and then an outsourced body, which was often made of wood. I mean, the picture that the entire picture there shows a wooden structure with plywood panels on the outside. And that's how a lot of early bodies were made. That particular body is from an early model, a Ford to earlier, and then the black and white picture in the corner that shows a Model T being fitted with a body that came from an outside contractor. So and that is how they were then delivered. Now, many of the activities Ford adapted to mass production, which is the making of mechanical components, is now carried out by suppliers. So we've done a lot of historical research into the history of mass production just to see why do we produce so many cars, Why do we have this overproduction problem just to see if there was a way in which we could realistically reduce production and yet still have a viable automotive business. So we came across this guy called Edward Budd. Edward Budd was also an American born in Delaware, and he actually invented with his colleague Joe Ledvinka, the old steel welded body. And this was quite a novel technology.\n\nAnd this, for the first time, allowed the mass production of car bodies as well as all the other components. This then eventually led to the development of the steel unibody or Monocoque, as we call it, in Europe, which is essentially a well, that's steel box that creates that carries the whole structure of the car so you can get rid of the separate chassis. You just have that box. And it is really this technology that determines the economics of modern car making. So when you go around a modern car factory, that is most of what you see. And he the picture here, the small picture is Edward Budd. The bigger picture is a 1930s, all steel welded body. And you see all those different elements in there are separate pressings that are welded together to create that box. 1930s structures were more complex than many modern ones, in fact. So that's quite pleased with that picture. So as I said. Board and especially bird technology, create the economies of scale in car manufacturing. And here we have a typical capital investment in a modern, so called assembly plant, which is a car factory. So you can see that the investment on the whole, the investment in making that steel body and then painting it are far bigger than the investment in traditional Ford technologies. The picture at the top there of the Schuler Kramer Transfer Press.\n\nThat is how a lot of these panels are pressed in a modern factory. So in the. The table here. I've budgeted for two of those which you would get in a big factory if you if you want to make 2 to 300000 cars a year. That's what what you have now that press, you can see the green thing on the left. That's where the flat bits of steel go into planks. So they're already cut into shape, but they're flat. They go in there. Then what's sitting by the side? There are die sets and I've got the second entry in the table. There has a budget for the die sets. The die sets are a male and a female, as they call it. You squeeze the sheet metal between it to create a shape. And typically in this particular setup, there are seven sets, so each panel goes through seven operations to then create a front wing or a door panel or a bonnet or a bootlid or something like that. It's usually between five or seven of these tools. So the reason why it is arranged there of \u20ac4,230 million for the die set, it depends on how complex your model range is. So for your \u20ac40 million you have one model in the model range for \u20ac130 million. You also have you pay your estate and things like that.\n\nThen the body and white is where all these panels are welded together. So that's largely robots and jigs that fix them in place. And then the robots and then the paint plant is the most expensive thing because steel rusts and people like that, cars in different colors and things like that. So that is your investment in a typical assembly plant. Then the picture at the bottom, that's final assembly. And as you can see, you see more people there at the top. There's only one little guy next to the machine. I don't know if you spot him, but he is lots of people on the assembly line because the assembly process is very people intensive. There's a few tools to help you like. You could see the orange thing at the moment, at the bottom that lifts up the power train, the engine and transmission into the body that's hanging above it, held above it, but it's mostly people who are there. So that's why it is lower capital investment. So these technologies determine economies of scale and mass production. And this is crucially important. It means that your break even point in a typical car factory, I say here between 120000 to 200000 per year. At 120,000, you're making luxury cars. Now, Saab, for example, who you may remember, their production was usually between 90,000 and 120,000 per year. So they very rarely reached break even point.\n\nAnd this is one of the reasons why they failed in the end. So you really need to make those very high volumes. I mean, Nissan here in the UK, which is generally considered the most efficient car factory in Europe, has between 300 and 400,000 annual capacity. It depends a bit on which model they make. So that's that's an efficient size. Once you go below those figures, you start losing money. Now, by contrast, I mean, I've got the picture there of a morgan I don't know if everybody's heard of the Morgan Car Company here in Britain. They are traditional coach built car. So they're made in the way. Cars were built before Ford and board came in there. Break even. Point is, at about 500 cars a year. That is how big the difference is. So we were really looking for many years. Is there a sort of in between level at which you can operate? And the industry has also been looking to fill that gap and has had limited success there. So that forces you into these very high levels of production. Now, once you produce it in those numbers, you need to sell them, of course. And some people worked out and in fact, by 1929 the US market had reached saturation point and any additional sales after that were purely due to marketing, which is an interesting thought.\n\n\nSo if demand doesn't exist, it needs to be created. Static demand is very problematic for the industry and growth is thus essential. So the car industry is a key part of that. That dreaded growth economy model that we in the environmental movement have so many problems with. And so far this growth has largely been achieved by making the car into a desirable must have consumer good and by tapping into new markets such as China most recently. Right. So how big are these guys? Well, this is I took 2019 as the last pre- pandemic year. Of course, with the pandemic, sort of volumes came down. Then we've had the chip salt shortage in the last couple of years, which is also affected production volumes. But as you can see, Volkswagen as a group is was the largest producer at that stage. About a third of that production and sales are in China. So they're very dependent on China, followed by Toyota, then Renault- Nissan, then General Motors. And then in recent years, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot have merged to form a new group, which they call Stellantis. And that would then be number five if you combine their volumes, which is at the bottom. So there is a big place now, these are big groups, but they operate with a number of different brands, which you may or may not be fully aware of. So General Motors, we know, has many different brands, but the others also operate under many different badges, which allows them to differentiate in the market.\n\nBut underneath a lot of these cars can share a lot of commonality, particularly in the Volkswagen Group, for example. And then at the bottom, you get the independents. I mean, Tesla is in there. Tesla has a capacity of about 1.5 to 1.9 million a year at the moment. It's been growing very rapidly in recent years. Right then, retail and distribution, once you've made them, you need to get them to the market and cars are typically sold through independent dealers. So the dealers are typically not owned by the manufacturer. There are exceptions to this. For example, in France, Italy, Germany and Japan, the manufacturers do own big dealers to to cover the territory. And these bigger dealers, these main dealers feed into smaller, privately owned dealers. Now, here in Cardiff, exceptionally, our local Renault dealer is directly owned by Renault in France. But that's that's a very unusual situation. So the dealers on the whole are not owned by the manufacturer. Many cars are shipped around the world and the little picture in the top corner is a a pure car and truck carrier. Ictsi. And it's a typical ship used for moving cars and commercial vehicles around the world. So they are dedicated vessels, Roro, as they call them, show you.\n\nRoll off and roll. Roll on. Roll off. So cars are driven in. They're very tightly packed. And that's how cars are shipped from Japan to Europe, from the US to Europe, from Europe to the US, from Korea, etc., etc.. They carry between 2005 thousand cars in a row. As you can imagine, they are they're quite flat sided and they're not very stable. They regularly go down in those areas of various of these things full of cars, various of these ships lying at the bottom of the ocean, various places anyway. So on the whole, they don't like shipping cars. So as long as if if a manufacturer finds there is enough demand in a particular market, they like to produce near that market rather than ship around the world because shipping from Japan to Europe takes about three weeks at least, and then you need to distribute them from the port and things like that. In addition, there is then an independent aftermarket, which is often again not owned by the manufacturers, and it supplies goods and services for vehicles in use. And I've got a little pie chart there that shows how that breaks down. And as you can see, the new car sale is only a relatively small part of the pie and that's controlled by the manufacturer. Then parts the is about a quarter, but only some of that is controlled by the manufacturer.\n\nPartly that is because the manufacturers themselves rely between 60 and 80% of the value of the car on outside suppliers. So these suppliers often can also supply straight into the aftermarket. Then there's vehicle finance, also a large chunk, only partly involving manufacturers. Then the body Shop. Body Shop is a large chunk, mainly because it operates under very high profit margins. It's not that everybody crashes all the time, but it's quite a profitable area. Insurance is a big chunk and then final repair and maintenance of cars is a small chunk. So manufacturers only capture a relatively small share of the total automotive lifetime value chain. And the profit margins on new cars are typically quite low between zero and 10%, often below zero, depending on how how luxury the car is. If it's a Porsche, it's much higher. But typical General Motors products, they make two or \u00a3300 per per car on the haul or euros. Suppliers take 20% of that chunk. Car manufacturers, only 18%. But this again, this is to do with the fact that the suppliers supply into the manufacturers, plant dealers, only a small chunk of it, and then the rest is that large aftersales area. That's where a lot of money is made and the manufacturers are not at the moment part of that. Right? So that's the first very quick overview of the industry.

I mean, at the moment, Tesla is the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, but BYD is coming up very rapidly and the Chinese are also producing models for other markets. But if you think of companies like Volkswagen in general Motors, for example, that are heavily reliant on the Chinese market, they're gradually being squeezed out by local manufacturers. So the growth is really fighting competition all the time. So they're all taking sales from each other and some manufacturers succumb on the way. I mean, I mentioned Saab earlier. Manufacturers do not survive because of competition. So there is a notion that was developed in the early 1990s that there is a minimum size at which you need to be able to operate, and that's at a capacity of about 4 million a year. This was first launched, this concept first launched by fiat at the time, but has since been since been adopted by other manufacturers and they reckon that only that gives you those economies of scale.

Environmental impact. The key thing is that it's more than just emissions, of course, but the focus has been on emissions. Now, at first when the car came in, say, around 1900, it was welcomed as a cleaner alternative to the horse. At that stage we had a horse economy which was actually relatively new that only developed in the previous 50 years or so. Now I've got some figures here from New York in 1900 which had 300,000 horses doing various jobs, and they left about 15,000 horse carcasses every year. They were worked very hard. The horses died. And you see this picture here, the picture on the left of the two pictures. You see some children playing by just next to a dead horse. This was not atypical of 15,000 horse carcasses. You then needed to get two horses in to drag that horse carcass away. Right. The other picture shows a street scene and you see a layer of essentially horse shit spread out all over the top of the road. And this was an accepted feature. And as you know, women had these long skirts at the time. And you can just imagine you picked up all sorts of rubbish on the way. They try to remove them in Europe, the whole shit because it's good manure of course, and it was used in the market gardens throughout the city. But still the cleaning up costs in New York alone cost $100 Million a year.\n\nSo when the car came along, they said, finally, we can get rid of this problem, right? So it was initially welcomed as a clean alternative to the horse economy. However, this changed and I've got this quote by from a book, The Great Car Craze by Ashley. Brilliant. He tracks the development of the car in Southern California, which in the early days was the most heavily motorized part of the world. So here with an irony, almost too tragic to be true, the clear blue, sunny skies, which more than any other factor, have been responsible over the years for attracting people to Southern California and for making it a motorist paradise became discolored and poisoned by the waste matter emitted daily by millions of motor vehicles. Now, there are some some issues specifically around the Los Angeles Basin area which made the problem worse there. I mean. I don't know if you've been there, but it's sort of it's in a bowl. It's surrounded by mountains and then the sea on the other side. Also, it has oil and tar underneath it. I mean, you get oil wells within the city. So so even Native Americans already call it a place of bad air. So if you have the natural by day about a you don't put a big city on top and then you run lots of cars in it, then you get problems.\n\nSo the emissions from an unregulated car I've outlined here, 97% of what comes out of an internal combustion engine car is actually nontoxic. It's water. And on a cold day like we've got here today, you see steam coming out of the back of the car. That is literally just steam. Oxygen comes out. That's not used for burning fuel. Nitrogen comes out, it's sucked in and sent straight out. And of course, carbon dioxide, no carbon dioxide we'll talk about in due course. But it's of course not toxic. We breathe it out ourselves. But 3% are toxic and really very toxic. Carbon monoxide is one of them, which is a byproduct of of incomplete combustion oxides of nitrogen. Nitrogen are formed from the nitrogen that's sucked in and then heated in the engine. So it's not a byproduct product of the fuel. It's just heating the nitrogen creates these oxides, that is the hydrocarbons, which are a byproduct of the fuel, unburned fuel, particulate matter, tiny bits of suit that can lodge deep into your lungs. And then there was also sulfur dioxide and sulfur dioxide. But we now have low sulfur fuel, so it's no longer a problem. But it was certainly in the fifties and sixties that was an issue. So in response to this regulation was introduced, I'm not going to take you through all the different bits of regulation, but this is sort of a summary. The interesting thing to note here is that California, which is the at the bottom left there, actually started regulating.\n\nUh, to control emissions before anybody else. And its first regulation in 1963 was positive crankcase ventilation. This is a little tube that takes addition to high pressure from the crankcase, the bottom of the engine, and sends it back in through the carburettor to to to be burned in the fuel. And they thought at that time that that that would solve the problem. It didn't. But it does mean that California was the first to regulate. It is for this reason that in the US there are two different standards of regulation as the California standard and there is the federal standard now. During the 1990s, a lot of states were saying, well, because California has its own standards, can we also have ours? And then the federal government said, no, we'll just have two standards. You either follow federal standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington or you follow the California Air Resources Board standards. So there are no 15 other states other than California that also follow the California regulations. And that made me in New England and along the West Coast. New York is one of them. And Washington, D.C. is another one, actually. So that's the two US standards. And the US was the first to regulate for vehicle emissions. Europe was relatively late initially it was regulated in Europe by the United Nations Economic Council for Europe, and their first measure was in 1971 and was positive crankcase ventilation.\n\nAnd then when the EU took over from the nineties onwards, you get the euro one, two, three, etc. and that's the program we're still on. E Technology in all of this is the catalytic converter which is that picture at the bottom there, which sort of converts the toxic materials and creates exhaust fumes that are much cleaner than what goes in at the front. And that's a relatively expensive piece of equipment, but it's mainly the regulatory computers that regulate that, that are expensive. However, they still get stolen underneath cars. I don't know if anybody has been victim to people like to steal them. Right. But what about CO two? I mean, we're all talking about CO2 these days, of course, because that's to do with climate change. Now, CO2 was largely ignored initially until about the 1990s when people started talking about it. And of course by 1997 we get the Kyoto Protocol. Now, unlike toxic emissions, which is driven by the US CO two, regulation has been driven by the European Union. And really when European negotiators excuse me, I'll take a bit more t. Then the EU negotiators came back from Kyoto and they identified the car industry as one of the biggest problems. So to talk to the car industry and initially negotiated a voluntary agreement with RCA, the association, the constructed European automobile who represent the car manufacturers.\n\nBut eventually, I mean, I say I could not stick to the voluntary agreement because, of course, customers buy whatever they're being offered by the manufacturers. And with competition, manufacturers sort of offered bigger and bigger vehicles and customers bought them so they couldn't meet those requirements. So then by about 2006, 2007, the commission said, all right, you guys can't stick to this. We'll now regulate. So that was the first regulation in the world of of automotive greenhouse gas emissions, which has since been followed by others. I mean, China initially followed the European regulations. Exactly, but now has diverse diverged slightly from it. As you can see in the pie chart, they are passenger cars are by far the biggest problem within the transport sector and this is why regulation of the car sector is so important. When you talk to people in the car industry, they say, Oh, it's unfair that we are so heavily regulated. What about shipping and things like that? But all you need to do is look at this pie chart and this is recent. This is 2020. Cars are still the biggest emitter within the transport field of greenhouse gas emissions. So that's being regulated for there are other impacts as well. Of course, the car really has shaped much of our world, especially in the 20th century, especially in developed countries in terms of infrastructure, politics, social change.\n\nThe impacts include, of course, congestion, infrastructure impacts, road building. I mean, in some cities like Phoenix, Arizona, for example, more than half of the urban space is dedicated to car related infrastructure. European cities aren't quite that bad, but I mean, that's how bad it that's as bad as it can get. There's the overproduction. We've already discussed resource consumption. Of course, you need to dig up massive amounts of stuff to make all these cars. And then there's the oil dependence, which has shaped our politics over the last hundred years. The reason we we are friendly with certain regimes that we might otherwise find unsavory is because we need their oil. So it has shaped the politics. Right. Sustainability, which really was the overarching arching principle, is really about considering the well of future generations in the decisions we make today. It's not about just about cleaning up the environment or something like that. It's really thinking about our great grandchildren. What sort of a world will they be living in and is it still worth living in? Now in Wales we have actually a well being of Future Generations Act, which means that all public sector bodies have to take future generations into account in any decisions made today. It doesn't always work, but that's the official requirement. But taking that approach requires a much more holistic approach to how we see the car system, then our current focus on emissions.\n\nSo that's really the main point I wanted to make. Now, we proposed in the 1990s and apologise. I apologise for the bad quality of this slide. I just scanned that little table from one of my publications in the nineties, but it's an approach we started to take to to capture in a more holistic way the environmental impacts of the car. We developed that further and we developed an environmental rating system of cars based on all these different criteria that was adopted by Volvo, for example, it was adopted by the province of Quebec for their car buying as well by the Environment Agency here. But I think it's gradually petered out over the years. It also influenced the piece of Japanese legislation in the late 1990s, the pop runner system. I don't know if you've heard of that, but for a while Japan geared its regulation by the best achievable technology in the market. So if if one company like Mitsubishi came up with a better technology anybody else then the standard was raised to that level which was quite interesting. But a lot of this sort of regulation seems to have petered out as the world obsesses about CO two an important issue, not minimizing it, but still. Right. So any questions on this short section?

Apparently, I used to have a Cadillac, but I think old friends just thought that's typical for him. Nobody else would buy something like that. Anyway, I've got a few quotes from sociologists and social scientists. Consumerism helps us figure out where we fit within society and provides provides the means by which to change social circumstances. And then Jackson, who is an expert on sustainable consumption, he says there are a few places where the insider material would have symbolic value our more naked to public scrutiny than in the case of the automobile. The car is a very visible means of expressing and showing the world who you are, who you want to be, what you aspire to, and things like that. And. This. This is an important part of social behavior. We explore it in some detail in our latest book. Should you want to know more about it? But that's just the introduction to it. But of course, consumption is bad for our environment, right? Especially of manmade stuff. This is true. But you cannot avoid consumption. I mean, most human activities have some environmental impacts. What matters is the amount and the type of consumption, clearly. But also one of the things to explore is our relationship with objects more generally.\n\nAnd it's important to. Challenge the notion that there is this real distinction with natural or manmade products and even with animate and inanimate human creations, use the materials we find on our planet. Right? So in that respect, we are like other animals. Beavers for their dams bursts for their nests, as they say. Our impact is, of course, greater. I'll admit that it's not inherently different. We only use what we found on the planet. Another thing that Morton, for example, argues, and others have argued this as well, that the concept of nature is itself unhelpful. By thinking of something like nature, we separate ourselves to something that's outside us. But in reality, we are we are part of that same system. And again, this is important to realize Morton calls it the mesh that we are part of. We are an integral part of that mesh, as is everything else on the planet. And that system does not recognize the hierarchy of objects that we pretend to have. We put ourselves at the top of some sort of hierarchy, but the natural systems don't recognize that, really. So human objects are not inherently superior to other objects that only something we have decided about. It's like we have decided about this distinction between natural and manmade and animate and inanimate. But it's all part of the same system. Human objects can also easily build an emotional relationship with other objects objects such as cars, clothes, mobile phones, etc., etc..\n\nI used to ask my students, What is your most prized possession? And for these mainly Chinese students, in my days in their twenties, their phone was the most important object. I think very often if it came to saving a human being some distance away and saving their phone in an emergency, they would probably save their phone. Right. We have to be realistic about these things. This is how human relationships with objects work. So such relationships potentially help us value the objects with which we share this planet and its attaching greater value to the few to the objects we consume. That is crucially important in the future of consumerism. Now, of course, a couple of quotes from this American philosopher of Central European origin co hack. He said Artefacts are not only products, but they are also gifts, be it of God or of nature. Their being has been bought at a price. Animal slaughtered, trees felled or mined. A gift, though, requires gratitude as a response. It is surely one of the most elementary prima facia obligations to treat a gift with respect. It might be sure sound far fetched to speak of my moral obligation to an aluminum beacon discarded by the roadside. Yet that obligation is real, not aluminum or aluminium, as we say, embodying both a prodigious amount of labor and a part of God's creation. Or in a secular metaphor, a nonrenewable resource is a gift.\n\nThere would be it may be my privilege to use that resource, that gift. It is immoral for me to waste it, and that's not how most people would think about it. But if we can get people to think more in those sort of terms, we will create a different attitude to consumer consumption and consumerism. So one of the elements within this is is product. I skipped a slide as part of more sustainable consumption. Then we need to build longer term relationships with more durable objects. I've got here the closed loop sort of diagram for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. I've had some dealings with them in the past specifically on this. Extending product lifespans and building these relationships, particularly with cars, is quite an important one. It also means we need to protect the freedom to tinker. Since the 1920s, we've been in a battle with the car makers whereby the car makers have tried to keep control of the product they sell us and try to prevent us from touching it and modifying it and personalizing it. Again, that's that's something that needs to be challenged. Obviously, we need to close the loops as well, but close them as late as possible. Another problem about closing loops is as we move into different materials. So moving from internal combustion to electric vehicles, for example, we also change the materials. So it's going to be more difficult to close certain loops.\n\nBut this quote at the bottom, most consumer products are discarded not because they no longer work, but because the user has fallen out of love with them is a key element of it. I've spent some time at waste sites looking at what's there, and you get televisions there that still work and things like that. You get a lot of electronic goods that actually still work. So why are they discarded? Because they're out of fashion, because they bought something new, but they've in a sense fallen out of love with it. But if these products could develop with the owner, people might keep them longer and would not seek a replacement so soon, which would again help the whole material flow through the system. So product durability then becomes a key element. And I've done quite a lot of work on longer life cars now for a while and occasionally pops up again. These scrappage schemes pop up, usually administered by governments, but usually inspired by the new car industry who are, of course more interested in selling new cars. So these premature scrappage schemes we looked at a few about 20 years ago, they rarely actually make sense environmentally. I mean, the excuse is usually we'll make cleaner cars, but rarely. If you look at the whole life cycle impact, does it make any sense? Now, this little graph down here shows the life cycle impact of a number of different types of car with the embedded carbon, like the light blue ones and the end use carbons compared.\n\nNow the first one at 160 grams per kilometre. That's actually most of the cars current and average. For most of the cars currently in use, they produce 160 grams per kilometre in use. So on those cars, the impact, the embedded carbon, the impact of manufacturing and discarding is between 20 and 30% typically which more efficient cars at 120 grams per kilometre, which is a lot of smaller cars today it creeps up, the embedded carbon creeps up when you go to a plug in hybrid at 78 grams per kilometre. These are all specific vehicles, but are you using them as an average? Then of course the embedded carbon in proportion to the whole creep. So if you go for 45 grams per kilometre, which is a battery electric EV and I know it's supposed to be zero emissions, but 245 grams per kilometre takes in the energy generating mix within the EU. Right. Which, which is not totally green, not totally renewable. So therefore there is still an impact but it's very low. But you can see with a battery electric vehicle, you get to a stage where the embedded carbon is actually more than the carbon emissions in use. And of course the more the the more green you make your generating mix, the bigger the embedded carbon becomes. So then you have to think, is it really worthwhile scrapping these cars at all, or is the investment in that vehicle such that we really need to keep it for as long as possible? So this is an interesting argument that is not being widely aired at the moment.\n\nIt's kept within small groups of academics at the moment, but it is a real issue that we will come up with in the coming years. Right now, in 2008, an ecologist called well, his name is obviously a German name, but he's American, spent some time at the Australian National University in Canberra as well. He this is really a handbook on ecology. But in the introduction he said that you are living in a century, 21st century, when we will be moving from an economic to an ecological world view. Now I thought that was very interesting because of course we are dominated by an economic worldview governments, businesses, everybody talks economics, but really this is very unhelpful. We really need to see if we can come to an ecological. A world view. But how do you go about it? So I've spent much of the last 15 years or so trying to work out how you would do this in the context of the car industry. Another interesting strand of philosophies, Panpsychism. I don't know if you've come across it. You've got a guy, Philip Goff, here in Britain, who is a proponent of it. As you may be aware, philosophers have for hundreds of years trying to work out what consciousness is and what it where it comes from.\n\nNow, the panpsychists, as you can probably work out, it means it's psyche everywhere. Argue that the only way you can explain consciousness if you assume it exists in some form at the molecular level. Now, if that is the case, that means that our so-called inanimate objects also must have a level of consciousness. I realize this is very philosophical stuff, but I'm just running it by you. So again, you come back to this system of the mesh and an integration. There is something we share within an inanimate object such as cars, for example, that most people wouldn't normally recognize. They say they're just objects, and because they're just objects, they are therefore disposable. And this is where the problems arise. So if we begin to think more in these sort of terms, that could be a major step to enable us to develop a more ecological world view which would then automatically make us more ecological actors. Right. Wolf. We also then need to do is see how natural systems I do still use the term nature because it's widely used, how natural systems work and natural systems favor diversity. The picture in the background here, by the way, I took that a few months ago, late last year, This isn't a person in mountains in West Wales. The Presidio Mountains is where the bluestones from Stonehenge came from. You know, Stonehenge is the sarsen stones, the big things.\n\nBut outside there is another stone circle made of blue stones. That circle was quarried here and was first set up in this area in West Wales, and somehow they got all those stones to Wiltshire, which is about 200 kilometres away from there. We still don't know how they did it, but it does show that although technology is not always the answer, humans can be extremely inventive in technologies to solve problems. Our problem at the moment is not shifting stones from West Wales to central England, but there you go. Natural systems favour diversity and they create they use diversity to create resilience in the system. If you look at a natural system, an ecological system, even if some individual species are lost, the whole system can survive because there is enough diversity within the system. So there are enough other species to take over the rules of the species you've lost. That is not how our current economic system thinks. We are obsessed with efficiency. Resilience to us often appears inefficient. We are used to systems that are efficient. The car industry is a classic example. You try and make it as efficient as possible, whereas we should really start thinking in terms of making our systems resilient rather than efficient, because efficient systems are often unable to adapt to change and an ability to adapt to change is exactly what we need at the moment.\n\nSo. Forget about efficiency. Go for resilience instead. Right. Any questions?

So, for example, car repair is in many cases not efficient tracking down arrows in the electronics when the self-diagnosis fails and getting the right spare part.

The last section, Right. The future. Right. The struggle to reduce and where possible, eliminate emissions of greenhouse gases ultimately have greater repercussions on the motor industry. Any efforts made to cut down the amount of greenhouse gases? This is something we wrote in the Green Car Guide in 1992 were for some reason I don't I don't know why we had that foresight. We worked out that really the attempts to reduce CO two and things like that would have a far greater impact on the car industry than cutting down toxic emissions. And that is how it's proving the reason why we are now seeing a revolution in the car industry is to deal with greenhouse gases. So the push for zero emission vehicles, you've already mentioned the Chinese influence there. They are really a response to both toxic emissions and climate change concerns. So greenhouse gases not those broader environmental concerns. However, I mean, this often makes for a useful proxy for the wider concerns. If a car is more has lower greenhouse gas emissions low or toxic emissions, that also often reduces other impacts, but not necessarily. So I've got the chart here shows the number of global electric vehicle sales really. And as you can see from the start, China has been a significant player and is still a significant player with about half of electric vehicle sales. And it's to do with various issues. And partly this issue I mentioned earlier on that the Chinese decided early on it would be much easier for them to compete on battery electric vehicles than on internal combustion technology.\n\nAnd to some extent, they've caught out the more developed countries in that respect, which are then following relatively late. So you can see earlier on by 2015, the others are also runs. But now we are beginning to build more sales and manufacturing in more established countries. The potential issues I flag up here are the higher embedded carbon in electric vehicles, which I explored earlier less abundant raw materials for electric vehicles. We are needing to access materials which are less plentiful than what we've traditionally used for internal combustion vehicles. And of course, there will be new economic and political dependencies. Rather than being dependent on, say, Saudi Arabia, we might be dependent on lithium from Bolivia or something like that. So these are all issues to consider, which again, are not always considered. Another thing is that size still matters, although Elon Musk assures us that he's saving the planet by making electric vehicles, his electric vehicles are very big. Even a model three weighs about 16 1700 G. And as you can see, even electric vehicles, even zero emission vehicles, you can make smaller. So this is a sort of footprint system we developed many years ago for for a client and I've since used a few times, I can give you the metric for this. It's it's a bit complex, but it's essentially a performance footprint.\n\nAnd you can see the Tesla model three is much bigger than, for example, the Renault Zoe small electric vehicle vehicle, and both of them seat five people even smaller is the river Simple racer This is the car I mentioned briefly. I'll mention it again soon which is made here in Wales. It's used uses a hydrogen fuel cell technology and a supercapacitor to to allow for extra energy for acceleration and things like that. So it's actually a very small power car. And then at the bottom of the note is, which is a little two seater that you may be familiar with that's even smaller. So it's. Large vehicles still use more raw materials and energy and construction and use, and they create more waste. This is inevitable whether they are zero emissions or not. So it's still an issue that needs to be addressed and at the moment is tends to be largely ignored. So size still matters. Electrification has a number of advantages, though it's zero emissions at point of use. So in your cities, if you have zero emission vehicles, you clean up your air. It's very easy, very desirable. Another advantage of electric vehicles, it gets cleaner as electricity generation gets cleaner. So you can introduce them now when we still have an energy generating mix that includes coal and stuff like that. And as we green the energy generating mix, our cars will also become greener and cleaner. So that's a nice one. It's something you can't do with internal combustion.\n\nReduced dependence on unsavoury oil regimes that we don't like. Electric cars are user friendly. They're nice to use, nice to drive. So you have an enhanced ownership experience. Again, a lot of people are still skeptical about them, but once they start using them, then like them, I should flag up. By the way, I do not have an electric vehicle myself. Right. Just saying that the assembly costs are potentially lower, electric vehicles are potentially simpler to build, but the material costs are higher. That's why they are still more expensive. They are potentially more durable and lower maintenance. And it's just as well because of that embedded carbon thing I flagged up earlier. But it does mean that we need to change the system such that we accept that electric vehicles will last longer and will be in use longer, which again affects that pushing cars into the system from from the beginning. The energy supply can be localised Again, this is something that's not often flagged up. But I could have solar panels on my roof. If I had a field, I could have some wind generators in there. And I can actually generate all the electricity to run my electric vehicle. Now, unless you have an oil well in an oil refinery in your back garden, you cannot do the same for an internal combustion engine car. And this is potentially a game changer. Traditionally, electric vehicles have been seen as an urban solution, but we sort of pioneered some work about 12 years ago whereby we said actually they are just as useful in a rural environment.\n\nHere in Wales, we have a strange geography. We have cities in the south and a few small towns in the north, and then in between it's all rural, it's all agriculture. And we've actually been working with some local communities there that have micro hydro systems, solar panels and things like that and have actually bought electric vehicles as pool cars just for their local communities because it is the most viable solution in those areas. We published some papers on this because again, it's not something that most people have twigged, but you can actually have very decentralised generating and car use systems because of electric cars. We are used to decentralize energy generation, big nuclear power stations and that sort of thing, but there is no need for that in the future. Right. There are some disadvantages as well. There is the embedded carbon I've already flagged up. Does the battery cost? At the moment the battery cost is between 30 and 50% of the vehicle vehicle value. So if you buy a new electric vehicle, a large chunk of it up to half is purely the cost of the battery. And it's partly to do with the fact that there are more esoteric materials needed in the battery. New supply chains are being created, which also will change the dynamics in the car industry at the moment.\n\nThe final assemblers, the Fords and General Motors are the big players and suppliers tend to be smaller. However, if you look at the top five lithium ion battery producers, by capacity, these are big businesses, LG Chem Korea and of course CATL, Chinese, BYD, Chinese, Panasonic, Japanese. These are all big companies and they can act as equal partners to the car makers. So you might get some changes in dynamics in supply chains as a result. Another thing you will get is the stranded assets of the legacy car makers. What are you going to do with all those engine factories that are sitting all over the world, for example, and the R&D and the expertise in making internal combustion engines for the electric vehicle? New skills are needed both in development, production, manufacturing sale, but also, of course, maintenance and repair. And that's only gradually coming on stream. There will be more pressure on electricity generation and distribution, and you also need a charging infrastructure again. People are working on this. We have been involved in projects on this as well. But you need to manage the grid much more. So you need smart meters installed that can sort of adjust your household consumption such that your car only charges overnight and things like that. So you do need these changes. Again, we're working on it. But again, these are investments that are needed and we might get a new dependence on different unsavory regimes. Now, a brief slide about hydrogen.\n\nI'm often asked, I don't know if it's come up in your work as well. Oral battery electric vehicles are all very well, But what about hydrogen? Hydrogen is often dismissed by people in the battery industry, but there may still be a role for hydrogen and electric vehicles as well. A hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle works very well. And this picture here is of the river Simple rasa. This is made just up the road in wheels and very small numbers at the moment. It's a tiny, lightweight vehicle to minimise resource use, minimise energy use, and it uses a small fuel cell. It's about this big a fuel cell you can buy off the shelf. So it's quite different from the fuel cells you find in Toyota and Hyundai fuel cell cars, which are American sized cars and very big fuel cells. Hydrogen avoids the heavy battery making. Hydrogen is energy intensive, but it is a very useful storage medium for excess renewable electricity. So if you have too much wind and solar power, one thing you can do with the excess is to turn it into hydrogen. Then you've got a way of storing it. Once you've got that hydrogen stored, you could, for example, run vehicles on it. And it suits some locations such as Iceland, for example. Particularly well. A small fuel cells such as used in that little card or ASA, is cheap. You can buy them off the shelf. A big one, as used by Toyota and Hyundai is not.\n\nIt's very expensive to engineer. So there's something to be said for this sort of line of thinking. So don't necessarily dismiss it. Right. The longer term impacts now, how do we close the loop during the transition? We've got a waste stream coming out of internal combustion engine cars, and we've got a new car stream that is battery electric vehicles. So there's not necessarily a good mesh there between those different waste streams. And this may affect some closing closing of loops. We may have to have bigger loops that we can feed those materials into other sectors, or we may just have to accept that there is no use for certain materials. It's something that needs to be explored. The new materials we need for battery electric vehicles and for hydrogen vehicles may be scarce other than for internal combustion engine vehicles. So overall production levels, it's quite possible. I don't know anybody who's looked at this, quite possible that those overall production levels that we are worried about can be sustained in the long term because of this. And then we've also got the fact that electric vehicles can last longer. Then there's the transformation of the electricity system that, again, decisions need to be made on that. Are we going for more centralised control, more nuclear power stations and things like that, or are we accepting that a more decentralised system like in rural Wales, for example, is the way to go, or can we do a bit of both? Again, those decisions need to be made.\n\nThen there is this total transformation of the aftermarket. To what extent can all the businesses that are currently catering for the aftermarket of vehicles in use still cater for electric vehicles in use? I mean. You need quite a high skill level to work on an electric vehicle. Never touch the orange cables in an electric vehicle because you'll be dead, for example. And there is no such danger at the moment in internal combustion engine vehicles. As long as you don't like to light a cigarette when you're opening the fuel tank or something like that, so different business models may result as it may come out as a result. Now, the table of coffee is actually quite interesting. I just picked this up last week. This is the mining quantities for different technologies. The top, the grey and black bars are mining quantities for fossil fuel production systems as a whole. Everything and the little blue ones at the bottom are the minerals needed for low carbon energy. I've not dug deeper into this. I trust the author knows what she's doing. But she's arguing here that the actual materials we need to shift for a low carbon energy system is a fraction of what we are currently shifting for fossil fuel production. So again, that's something that we need to keep an eye on. That would be quite interesting. Even though the materials we use are rarer, more esoteric and need more processing perhaps.\n\nSo that's again a nice angle. I mentioned new business models. I was going to say something about our own micro factory retailing, but it's too, too, too niche. But Tesla itself also uses a new business model. It's highly integrated with very strong centralized control, although it still uses conventional mass production if you look at how the cars are made. The systems they use largely German manufacturing technology, very similar to what BMW uses, for example. That's quite conventional. One thing they do in houses, of course, they make their own batteries. At the moment, other than BYD in China, they're the only electric vehicle maker that makes its own batteries. Another aspect of them, they have an integrated retail and distribution system. So I said earlier on, the model in the car industry is that dealers are separate businesses. Tesla outlets are all owned by Tesla, and that's again part of their business model. They also have this online software update system, which means that whenever you plug your car in to recharge, software can be updated in the car from the US. Another thing they do is they own two other company, SolarCity, which makes solar panels, and Powerwall, which has domestic storage batteries that that you can use as a buffer to store, store your own generated electricity or between the grid and your house. That's also made by Tesla. So they have a very integrated holistic business model that is unusual in the car industry, and that's because they're not really a car company.\n\nThey are a tech company, as they keep telling us. Now, finally, a quick word on connected and automated vehicles. This is a big thing, especially among academics outside the car industry. This is the self driving car thing. People inside the car industry have some doubts about this, mainly because it's extremely difficult to do and it's unclear what the benefits are. Another thing is that it would give, again, more centralized control to tech companies because your car will be controlled from outside. In a sense, it goes back to the horse. You're sitting in a vehicle that has a mind of its own. You cannot control it. Another thing that. People in the tech industry don't always appreciate this. Artificial intelligence is not enhanced human intelligence. It is a new, different type of intelligence, and it will therefore make unusual and unexpected decisions. And we are not necessarily prepared for that. Hacking vehicles by criminals is a real danger. It's already been done by a number of people experimentally. People have hacked into Fiat, into Chryslers, into Mercedes cars. Remotely. So that is a real danger. And the car industry is not very good at cyber security. And I can't see them getting much better very soon either. Another thing is that full automation is unlikely to work in all environments, so we'll probably see it develop in certain carefully controlled urban environments where you know exactly what's going to happen, where things are predictable.\n\nThat's probably where we will see automated vehicles. Another point I would like to make is that automated vehicles are not like cars. They're not self driving cars. They are a new and different transport mode. They're an additional transport mode. But this argument keeps popping up all over the place, although over the last year it's gone quite a bit as the companies working on it have realized how incredibly complex it is. So people who are keen to drive like myself hope it'll all go away. It'll probably hang about in some form. So it's again, something to keep an eye on. Right. Finally, the essence of the car. And it's different from a self driving one. It's like a horse without a mind of its own. So you have more control over it. It's like a bicycle, which you also have full control over. I'm also a cyclist. I have five bicycles, but it has greater range. And you've got more room. You've got this safe and closed space that people really value. It also becomes part of human experience as people remember road trips. People remember where they've been with the car and things like that. And this is part of them developing that emotional attachment to to the car. And for these reasons, people will fight to protect it. Another thing to remember, if you look at the history of technologies, you find that very few technologies actually completely disappear. So it's quite possible that internal combustion engine cars will persist in small niches.\n\nI mean, think of sailing ships. We have better technologies for ships, but there are still plenty of sailing ships around, sailing boats, Lots of people sail steam Trains are still about right. They operate in niches as tourist attractions, as hobby items and things like that. Horses are still in use. I mentioned the horse economy earlier on, but lots of people have horses. So these technologies don't go away usually. And it's quite possible internal combustion engine cars will not completely go away even when we have better alternatives, but we'll still persist in small niches. Right. Finally, paper again. I came across last week, published in December about climate change, and it says climate change mitigation. We won't hit the target of one and a half degrees, for example, probably this century. We may hit it next century. This means that we have to adapt as well. They run the paper, looks at all the current models and runs through them and looks at what's actually happening, looks at the cop commitments and things like that, and said the current COP commitment is just not going to happen this century. So we are going to face a number of issues. Which doesn't mean that we should stop worrying about greenhouse gas emissions. I give you this classic cartoon, which you may have seen before. What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing? Right. We should still keep trying. Right.

Specifically I would like to know, \"what does the automotive industry optimize for\"? What is it good at, and how is that decided?\n\nIt's apparently not optimized for vehicle longevity, ease of repair, and low total cost of car ownership. As much was quite clear to me from my research when writing my article \"[Automotive Nightmares](https://edgeryders.eu/t/automotive-nightmares/16279)\". (That article has quite some absurd and funny anecdotes about contemporary cars \u2026 and later a client told me [some more](/t/16279/5). Enjoy :laughing: )\n\nWhat was not clear to me, and it has been an open question ever since, are the organizational mechanisms that nudged or forced automakers to create *these* products, rather than cars optimized for reliability, low resource consumption, longevity, ease of repair and so on.

Paul Nieuwenhuis, an expert on cars and the environment, talks with Edgeryders about the problems and solutions.**\n\n![Paul Nieuwenhuis Article Header|690x388](upload://zEPRBjQoRPqvhEjQCEuciUwVV1u.jpeg)\n*Illustration: Inge Snip*\n\n\u201cThe impact of the car is not just tailpipe emissions; it\u2019s much broader,\u201d Paul Nieuwenhuis says during a Zoom call earlier this Summer. We speak with Paul, who headed the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School and the Electric Vehicle Centre of Excellence at Cardiff University as co-director and who has written several books about cars and the environment, to dive into how - if at all - cars can be part of a sustainable future.\n\nOften when talking about the environment, sustainability, and cars, people tend to think of how an individual car pollutes the environment, Paul explains. We think of emissions. This is also where he started his research several decades ago.\n\n> **The impact of the car is not just tailpipe emissions; it\u2019s much broader**\n\nBut he soon realized that emissions were the \u201ceasy\u201d part to control, partly due to the innovative work of California State\u2019s California Air Resources Board in Sacramento. Due to L.A.s geographic environment and the design of the city, already in the 1950s, the state had the most progressive legislation on emission control globally. To this date, legislation coming from the board is being used and replicated not only in other parts of the States but also by other countries.\n\nAfter working as a consultant at a management consultancy specialising in the car industry, Paul was attracted as a researcher at Cardiff Business School, where he published his first book in 1992, [The Green Car Guide](https://archive.org/details/greencarguide00paul/page/n1/mode/2up). \u201cPeople thought we were visionaries,\u201d Paul laughs, \u201cbut we were taking a lot of inspiration from California State\u2019s California Air Resources Board.\u201d\n\nIn The Green Car Guide, Paul and his colleagues pointed out that it isn\u2019t only emissions that threaten our environment.\n\n\u201cI was one of the first to emphasise that the habit of throwing away a car after 15 years is foolish,\u201d he says. But he was interested in exactly why this was (and still is) happening.\n\n> **The habit of throwing away a car after 15 years is foolish**\n\nProduct durability has been part of humanity for thousands of years - the throwaway society was developed over the last 100 years. From washing machines to phones to cars. \n\nRegarding cars, there are a couple of reasons for this, not only consumers \u201cfalling out of love\u201d with the products. This includes the materials used in cars, the automotive industry lobbying for strict periodic testing, the complexity of cars and the circular economy, and how to interpret durability: company-owned cars or full autonomy and the \u201cright to repair\u201d?\n\n**Materials**\n\nA modern car plant\u2019s break-even point for a mass-produced model is between 180,000 and 200,000 a year. They lose money when they fall below that. That has mainly to do with the body of cars: all steel. That is where the high investment is. Steel is a capital-intensive technology that forces economies of scale. Paul explains that their only option is to produce at that level and then sell.\n\n\u201cWe know where the problem is. If you get rid of that technology, you can go for lower economies of scale and not be forced to produce in those high volumes,\u201d Paul says, \u201cThen can then build cars that can last longer and perhaps create a different business model whereby you make the car. You keep it in the market, maintain it, and keep it going.\u201d\n \n**Alternative business models**\n\nPaul and his colleagues devised an alternative business model to counter these economies of scale: micro-factory retail. It\u2019s based on low-volume manufacturers, a fracturing localised to its market, combined with a sales and maintenance model. Small industrial units assemble cars, and customers buy straight from those facilities. They can specify the vehicle to their needs, and local suppliers can feed into it. If demand for new cars declines, the company can deal with maintenance, repair, upgrading, and recycling. \n\nThis model was picked up by several people around the world, including Local Motors, by implementing a crowdfunding model whereby people can chip in to design their own car using a centralised piece of basic software. \n\nAnother example is the company Hugo Spowers launched in the UK called Riversimple. They have developed a small hydrogen fuel cell car in the Wales area based on a kind of leasing, a product service system. People lease the car, and then the company takes them back and reconfigures them for the next customer. They do all the repair and maintenance that\u2019s needed.\n\nGordon Murray, who designed the first carbon fibre monocoque Formula One car and a road car, the McLaren F1, ventured into environmental car design. He came to Paul and his colleague Peter Wells and picked up on the micro-factory retailing. He develops concepts, including the manufacturing concept. The product can then be placed around the world.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s also how we envisage the micro-factory retailing concept,\u201d Paul says, \u201cnot everybody needs to do the design. The basic design is modularised, and the factory is modularised, but then you can configure it locally for local tastes and allow local suppliers to come in.\u201d\n\n\n**A circular economy?** \n\nThe circular economy model assumes a static technology situation, Paul explains. The steel from which most cars are made is very recyclable, but if you build a circular economy system around that, it assumes cars are made of steel.\n\n> **The circular economy model assumes a static technology situation**\n\nFor example, the Renault Espace has essentially galvanised steel framework onto which there are plastic panels. It\u2019s a hybrid technology. Audi\u2019s Jaguar also makes largely aluminium cars. Then you get technologies like the BMW i3. It\u2019s built on an aluminium platform and has a carbon fibre superstructure. Carbon fibre is a bugger to recycle. You can only grind it down and use the powder you get as a filler for other products. But \u201ca structure like that of the BMW i3 should last 40 or 50 years without too many problems,\u201d Paul says. \n\nThe next question, Paul continues, is if there is an actual demand for whatever it produces. Or, how do you understand your circular economy? \n\n\u201cDo we have the circularity within one product, one in one industry, within one sector, within a locality, and a region?\u201d Paul says.\n\n> **Do we have the circularity within one product, within one product, one in one industry, within one sector, within a locality, and a region?**\n\nAt the moment, many of the recyclers from various industries end up in other kinds of products, like old tires in playground surfaces. But, often, within the circular economy concept, the loops are much closer than that. Another issue is it might create a static system where material innovations are discouraged because they complicate the loop. \n\nIf you change the battery technology from lithium to another one, what do you do with all the waste lithium from the older batteries? From the current crop of cars? How do you accommodate that? These things can all be done, but you must be prepared. This refers to the waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle.\n\nWhat about the area within which your loop operates? A closed loop needs to be more specific as to whether the loop should be closed within a single product type, e.g., mobile phones, computers, or cars. Or within one sector? e.g., construction or within one economy. And if so, is that a local, regional or national economy? Those are our main three areas of concern about the closed-loop economy.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the concept is still too theoretical and too conceptual. Yet, now is when we need to get to the nuts and bolts of how we will do this,\u201d Paul says. \u201cThe data is coming through, and the information is coming from what sort of material flows will be produced in the future and how they differ from existing material flows. But these things need to be addressed within the circular economy community.\u201d\n\n\n![Untitled design (75)|690x690](upload://avbjaq6lu8REFNZi84RaTzlzkQ3.jpeg)\n\n\n***Dr Paul Nieuwenhuis** is a self-styled \u2018automotive philosopher\u2019.

So, I've been a car guy from a very early age. In the 1980s, I worked for a management consultancy specialising in the car industry, which was spun off from the University of East Anglia. \n\n![Picsart_23-10-16_11-55-48-011|690x456, 50%](upload://c7ey1suY8lu9muqLOBVQKWj5qBK.jpeg)\n\n*DAF Factory. Suyk, Koen / Anefo | Nationaal Archief*\n\nIt was clear that there was an increasing awareness of environmental pressures within the car industry, perhaps much more than in other industries. Much of that came from California, which had the [first emissions control regulations](https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/timeline-major-accomplishments-transportation-air) aimed explicitly at cars starting in the late 1950s.\n\n### The Californian regulation\n\nHistorically, the area where they built the city of Los Angeles is full of tar oil. Even the Chumash Indians knew it as a place with bad air. It's got the sea on one side and the mountains all the way around. It is a basin that holds bad air. There, they built a massive city, stuck it full of cars and trucks, and created an enormous port full of ships. It was going to be one of the first places in the world to hit this problem. \n\nPeople first started to notice differences in air quality from the 1940s onwards. They noticed that when they moved to L.A., the sky was blue, but with time it turned brown. \n\nWhy was that? They started to look into it and suggested for the first time that cars were the problem. They made [changes](https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/timeline-major-accomplishments-transportation-air) before the federal government did. Even today, they are allowed to legislate separately from federal legislation.\n\n![image|617x371](upload://wHbJyhRygFjL6XJ372oIJnk6pcp.jpeg)\n*Smog blankets Los Angeles in 1958. Photograph: AP*\n\nThis means California regulations will continue to be created by the California Air Resources Board in Sacramento. Several other states started to follow this in the 1990s. The federal government decided that States could follow federal or California's legislation but nothing else. About 20 or 30 states follow California regulations. They've become quite significant.\n\nIn the early 1990s, when I was with Cardiff University Business School, we had a centre for automotive industry research. I was recruited into that as one of the researchers. Because I had already been studying the car industry from an environmental perspective in my consultancy days, I brought that environmental perspective with me. I also brought my first book, which was published in 1992, **[The Green Car Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Green-Car-Guide-Paul-Nieuwenhuis/dp/1854250760)**. I wrote that with two colleagues from my consultancy days (n.a. **Peter Cope**, **Janet Armstrong**). \n\n![image|429x690, 50%](upload://nkeSWbMPZiIqPHTHVxsksurS8WC.jpeg)\n\n\nVery few studies like ours were available. But it was clear that the California Air Resources Board was critical to it all, at least for emissions and air quality legislation. Much of our work was going to Sacramento, talking to the California Air Resources Board, and then coming back to Europe and letting everyone know what would happen. \n\nOne thing we found, which was very difficult to sell to our academic bosses, is that **the car industry was aware of the negative impact of emissions from a very early stage**. Even though they may not have acted accordingly, they knew what was coming. They had people in place who could deal with these technologies. ***(how did they know it - examples?)***\n\nWe then said, listen, the impact of the car is not just tailpipe emissions; it's much broader. That's also covered in that little book, The Green Car Guide, where we explore other things we must consider. \n\n### Economies of scale\n\nDuring the 1990s, I started to pursue those different strands of activity because it was pretty clear that tailpipe emissions were controlled: they were subject to a legislative trajectory, but the other things were not. \n\nOne of the areas was product durability. I was one of the first to emphasise that the habit of throwing away a car after 15 years was foolish. Some people picked up my research in that area at the time, including the **[New Economics Foundation](https://neweconomics.org/)** here in the U.K., who have done similar work on white goods. We organised a few workshops together where they focused on ***white goods*** and consumer goods, and I focused on cars.\n\nOne of the problems of the car industry is [overproduction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/car-market-prices-plummet-due-153706713.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGQ_T0kEoIyLC0GYtvB7zqsqoKok43EPi2T0sBzyBkDa_z33g9r7dcY_qV3lAqFShAS3muoggyGKmHQl87qlR3JSu6QELBwFrWvvVgLPCib30lTCtMREfR-828uR7YDBITRO_rykgXxshWFAdqGBs6WD3opGXWVPGpA-ahOtMr29&guccounter=2). This is also why cars are thrown away after 15 years because cars are pushed into the system at the front, making them prematurely obsolete, and therefore people get rid of them.\n\nWe then started to understand why the production volumes were what they were. And at that stage, my colleague Peter Wells and I started to look into where those economies of scale came from. We were both within the economic section of the business school at the time, and economists seemed to think economies of scale were economies of scale. \n\nBut once we started digging, we realised that's not the case. It depends on the technology that the car industry uses that forces the economies of scale: **the all-steel body.** \n\nCars consist of basically a welded steel box. That is where the high investment is. \n\n![6048831747_93dcb004d7_o|690x477, 50%](upload://mSglAhJ0THu35PqxljK63CXh0ou.jpeg)\n*Archived by: Steve Shook*\n\nThis was quite a novel work. We spent a lot of time on the history of mass production by going into stuffy libraries in the U.S. and looking through contemporary sources from 1910 to 1915. **[Edward Budd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Budd)** developed the all-steel welded body around 1912-14 when Ford created the moving production line.\n\n![Edward_G._Budd_Sr._circa_1925|473x690, 50%](upload://zMuJg3H3pPbPR4EmvidFNZEfmqL.jpeg)\n*Edward Budd. Public Domain*\n\nWe also discovered Ford did not mass-produce cars. The Model T was essentially a running chassis. *It was a car without a body. If you go back historically, people saw the car as a mechanical device; you'd take it to your coachbuilder, and they would put a body on it.* That's how it was thought of. Nowadays, if you go into a car factory, all you see are bits of steel being stamped and welded into bodies. Then the body is painted. After that, some people come around to put seats in it, wheels on it, and engines in it. But that was a key innovation. \n\n![1925_Ford_Model_T_touring|690x517](upload://wqDWQLins5usXoqZtIyzcGx4wqE.jpeg)\n*1925 Ford Model T Touring Car*\n\nWe then discovered this transition from the way Ford made cars and production using the way cars are made today. That was the crucial step. It was Budd who was vital in that. And that rolls out in the twenties and thirties and beyond. \n\nBut the problem is that such a capital-intensive technology forces economies of scale. As a result, a modern car plant's break-even point for a mass-produced model is between 180,000 and 200,000 a year. They lose money when they fall below that unless they are a specialist producer. Their only option is to produce at that level and then sell. \n\nWe [published our findings](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296540300_The_death_of_motoring_Car_making_and_automobility_in_the_21st_century?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InByb2ZpbGUiLCJwYWdlIjoicHJvZmlsZSJ9fQ) in the 1990s in the public domain. We know where the problem is. If you get rid of that technology, then you can go for lower economies of scale and not be forced to produce in those high volumes. They can then build cars that can last longer and perhaps create a different business model whereby you make the car, then you keep it in the market, maintain it in the market, and just keep it going. That's not even looking at the circular economy side but looking at the vehicle in use. \n\n### Alternative business models\n\nFortunately, in the U.K., the country is full of low-volume car makers. We started to work with some of them, including Lotus and Morgan. We did the rounds here and in Germany and Italy, where [low-volume car productions](https://www.motortrend.com/news/new-law-makes-it-easier-for-low-volume-manufacturers-to-build-replicas/#:~:text=*%20A%20%22low%20volume%20manufacturer%22,in%20the%20U.S.%20each%20year.) also exist.\n\nI was on a government advisory committee together with **Charles Morgan** (N.A. *the managing director of the Morgan Motor Company, a UK car manufacturer*). I got to know him quite well. We helped him explain to his financial backers how his business model was completely different from that of the Fords and General Motors. \n\nWe got to understand how you can make cars in lower volumes, and we published quite an [influential paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313508965_Micro_factory_retailing_a_radical_business_concept_for_the_automotive_industry), not in academic circles but in industry circles in 2000. We proposed a new *alternative business model based on low-volume manufacturers*, a fracturing localised to its market, and combined it with a sales and maintenance model. It's called **micro factory retail**, where small industrial units assemble cars, and customers buy straight from those assembly facilities. They can specify the vehicle to their needs, and local suppliers can feed into it. \n\nIf demand for new cars declines, the company can deal with maintenance, repair, upgrading, and recycling. This was picked up by several people around the world, including local motors. They use a crowdfunding model whereby people can chip in and essentially design their own car using a centralised piece of basic software they can help configure. \n\nLocally, we were approached by a guy called **Hugo Powers**. He has since set up the company [Riversimple](https://www.riversimple.com/), based in Wales. Although it is a small business, they're swamped. He picked up this idea because he could see that the ideas he had already been forming would fit quite nicely with this business model. He got some backing from members of the Percy family and others. He's developed a small hydrogen fuel cell car. He's building a fleet of 50 cars that will be placed with people in the local area. His business model is based on a kind of leasing, a product service system. You lease the car, and then the company takes them back and reconfigures them for the next customer. They do all the repair and maintenance that's needed. \n\n![IMG-20220419-WA0005-1259x840|690x460](upload://bMVYM0fDAhtmV2fth62ivtZLvIX.jpeg)\n\n\nOne of his arguments was that when you look at the fuel cell cars that the industry has, they are mainly large American cars. But what if you can get small off-the-shelf fuel cells for next to nothing. The entire car is much cheaper by configuring a very lightweight small car around that. That's what he's done. It's a very lightweight little car, and it does everything you need it to do. \n\n**Gordon Murray** designed the first carbon fibre monocoque Formula One car and a road car, the McLaren F1, which is supposed to be the best supercar ever made. Now I've never driven one. I can't afford one. But he has enormous prestige in the car industry. \n\nMurray decided around 2000 he wanted to venture into environmental car design. He came to us and picked up on the micro-factory retailing idea as well. His model is that he develops concepts, including the manufacturing concept. The product can then be placed around the world. You would have a network of factories. \n\n![image|690x371](upload://7UHGtiMmM7UvOhc1TC81vEXg0bp.jpeg)\n\n\nThat's also how we envisage the micro-factory retailing concept. Not everybody needs to do the design. The basic design is something that's modularised, and the factory is modularised, but then you can configure it locally for local tastes and allow local suppliers to come in.\n\n--\n\nWith the transition to electric vehicles, vehicle technology will become more straightforward than an internal combustion engine. That is an advantage. And you don't need emissions control, which is where a lot of the engine management computer work comes in. \n\nBut, back to durability, humanity has been doing product durability for thousands of years. We didn't have a throwaway society, but it has developed in the last 100 years. If you look at what Henry Ford said (I quote him frequently, in spite of his political stance) when he sold the Model T, \"the man who buys one never to have to buy another.\" \n\nHe envisaged that if you bought your Model C, you would keep it for life. A whole aftermarket industry, especially in the U.S., supplied bits for it. If your Model T was too basic (and they were very basic), you could add all sorts of things. Many of those were designed by ordinary drivers, ordinary citizens, and small-scale inventors.\n\nIn the 1920s and thirties, the car industry was gradually professionalised, whereby the car industry decided \"We don't want all these people tinkering with our products. We want to control everything.\" I describe this to some extent in my [2014 book](https://www.amazon.com/Sustainable-Automobility-Understanding-Natural-System/dp/1783472677).\n\n![image|318x498](upload://ryQbHcRtaRQWYmLx6YcykQLKwAG.jpeg)\n\n\nThis has now taken an extreme form with Tesla. Tesla has a total control system to the extent that if you start fiddling around with a Tesla, a voice will come out of the car and say, \"What are you doing to our cars?\" \n\nWe have long advocated this sort of hands-on approach for various reasons. But product durability is not just a technological issue, and it's also a psychological issue. You must build a relationship with the product to look after it and to make it last a long time. I've done some papers on the classic car movement. I'm a classic car owner myself. My classic car is it's a Dutch DAF. It's a 55 coupe, of which very few are in the U.K. I'm also the chairman of the DAF Owners Club in the U.K. \n\n![48546629692_310eb9b338_o|690x517](upload://9tJ8JDy9nL3u6CPepqKT7i37fwW.jpeg)\n*Photo by: Harry_NL*\n\nWith classic cars, you get people who essentially take an old banger and just keep it going, spend money on it, and lavish a lot of love and attention just to keep it going. My DAF 55 was designed for a working life of ten years, and **it's 50 years old now and still roadworthy**. It passed its periodic test a few weeks ago.\n\nThe classical movement could form a model for a future, more durable car. But that would mean that the manufacturer needs to give up some control frequency. That is going to be a real challenge. However, all over the world, freedom-to-tinker legislation is popping up for various sectors where consumers will be given an inherent right to do things to the products once they've bought them. \n\nNow, this is where a slight problem comes in because the environmental movement often advocates a product surface system approach whereby the end user doesn't own the product, but the manufacturer or a management company manages it. That, of course, means that you would have less ownership of the product and less of that bond. Within an ownership model, it's easier to build that bond. This is something that needs to be resolved in some way. \n\n*The only problem when thinking of the circular economy is controlling that waste stream*. If you have a very intensively used product, you still have a fast waste stream, and you need to work out how to deal with that. Whereas with a personal ownership model, your waste stream could be delayed. For example, if a car lasts 30 years instead of 15, that greatly hinders the waste stream.\n\nIn the 1970s, Polish researchers studied how long a car could last by using different materials on behalf of the German Democratic Republic to assess. They deny all knowledge of it, but I have a copy and referenced it in many of my works. The research reckons a car can easily last 25 to 30 years with minor improvements. \n\n--\n### The used cars flows\n\nWe did a study about 20 years ago about the flow of used cars around the world. We went to the U.S. but found flows from there to the Middle East - mainly Lincoln Town cars and similar ones. \n\nThe most interesting flow we found was from Japan. In Japan, they have a rigorous periodic testing regime. Essentially, after five years, you must completely rebuild your braking system. Cars are expensive to repair in Japan but cheap to buy. Many people decide they'll buy a new car after five or seven years, and the old cars are shipped somewhere. \n\nThe biggest market for those is New Zealand. New Zealand imports between 120 and 150,000 used Japanese cars every year. And again, most ordinary New Zealanders drive those used Japanese cars and keep them going. \n\nSome flows go from there into East Africa and the Caribbean. A similar flow goes from South Korea into Russia via Vladivostok. You could see fishing boats from Russia with several cars piled on the deck.\n\n![Picsart_23-10-16_13-02-45-893|690x474](upload://zzZo2JDqE89N9IinM1NEbRWhVyt.jpeg)\n*Screengrab cars on deck*\n\nThe reason for these strict rules is purely to *protect domestic car manufacturers*. That's the main drive. \n\nThis is one of the reasons why the German rules, for example, are quite rigorous. And why in Germany you can't modify cars. All sorts of restrictions specify what kind of alloy wheels you can fit to your cars in Germany, whereas here, for example, you can stick anything on your ride. That sort of legislation is driven by the car manufacturers under the guise of safety, but, IMO, it has very little to do with safety.\n\nCar manufacturing is the world's largest manufacturing industry still. Of course, it's bigger in some countries than in others, especially in countries like Japan and Germany. But also, the U.S. has quite a strong car lobby and a very strong car union. The **United Auto Workers** in the U.S. can put a lot of pressure on the government, for example, to stop car makers from producing in Mexico. And then metal in Germany, which is also the union for the car industry, not just for the metal industry, is Europe's most powerful union. Unions and car makers in tandem determine a lot.\n\n--\n\nPeter and I first came across the circular economy in the 1990s. One thing that struck us - because this coincided with our work on looking at mass production alternatives is that **the circular economy model assumed a static technology situation**. \n\nOf course, the steel from which most cars are made is very recyclable. But if you build a circular economy system around that, it assumes cars are made of steel. When we were doing this work, alternative materials were entering the industry. \n\nFor example, Renault Espace has essentially galvanised steel framework onto which there are plastic panels. It's a hybrid technology. Audi's Jaguar also makes largely aluminium cars. A lot of companies now make aluminium cars. Aluminium is also recyclable, so you need to find demand for steel and aluminium. \n\nThen you get technologies like the BMW i3. We spent some time with BMW looking at how the i3 is made. It's a little BMW electric car. It's built on an aluminum platform and has a carbon fibre superstructure. *Carbon fibre is a bugger to recycle*. You can only grind it down and use the powder you get as a filler for other products. On the other hand, a structure like that of the BMW i3 should last 40 or 50 years without too many problems. So you get all those trade-offs. \n\n![image|690x398](upload://m8PpTXvp61n3V9peWpTyJ9G7TnY.jpeg)\n*BMW i3*\n\nIn this period, we're in the middle of transitioning from internal combustion engines to electric motors. You can melt internal combustion engines down and turn them into new castings either out of cast iron or aluminium, but do you necessarily have a demand for whatever it produces? \n\nThat's why another thing we flagged: how do you understand your circular economy? I have the circularity within one product, within one product, one in one industry, within one sector, within a locality, and within a region. How does your circularity work? Because, at the moment, many of the recyclers from various industries end up in other kinds of products, like old tires in playground rubble.\n\nFrom talking to the people who promote the circular economy concept, the loops are much closer. And that is something I have yet to see fully discussed or resolved. \n\nThere are three points we mentioned specifically. The first point is **that close-loop homes on reuse and recycling**. We need to look into the most important: to reduce. \n\nThen, the other one is creating **a static system where material innovations are discouraged** because they complicate the loop. Lithium, for example, is a classic with lithium batteries. But if you change the battery technology to another one - and there are many other technologies in the pipeline - what do you do with all the waste lithium from the older batteries? From the current crop of cars? How do you accommodate that? These things can all be done, but you must be prepared. This refers to the *[waste hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_hierarchy).* \n\n![image|690x394](upload://byNkuZKE07GLruYLSpr8cE69cu5.jpeg)\n\n\nAnd then the final point, the third point, is **what area within your loop operates in**? A closed loop needs to be more specific as to whether the loop should be closed within a single product type, e.g. mobile phones, computers, or cars. Or within one sector? e.g., construction or within one economy. And if so, is that a local, regional or national economy? So those are our main three areas of concern about the closed-loop economy. \n\nWhen we first looked at it in 1990, it still needed to be addressed. And I've been to some conferences in recent years, as have some of my co-authors on this book, and we've yet to see people discuss that in any detail. Currently, the concept is still too theoretical, and too conceptual. \n\nYet, now is when we need to get to the nuts and bolts of how we will do this. The data is coming through, and the information is coming from what sort of material flows will be produced in the future and how they differ from existing material flows. But these things need to be addressed within the circular economy community.", "post_number": 1, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 4, "readers_count": 3, "incoming_link_count": 13, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 95.8, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "inge", "reply_to_post_id": 119631}], "16838": [{"topic_id": 16838, "post_id": 104745, "username": "inge", "user_id": 1856, "created_at": "2022-04-22T05:30:31.932Z", "raw": "I made a start with mapping different interesting communities and experts and will continue adding to these, plus I'll add the events I found to the right topic.

Some participants approached the task through more of a macro lens, while others took a more micro approach. \n\nThe more \"macro\" approach yielded a discussion that was very much in line with insights from the paradigm of political ecology -- the interdisciplinary approach to environmental problems that emerged from the political economy approach in social sciences, and which \"seeks to understand the complex relations between Nature and Society through careful analysis of social forms of access and control over resources -- with all their implications for environmental health and sustainable livelihoods\" (Watts and Peet 1996 in \"[Liberation Ecologies\"](https://www.routledge.com/Liberation-Ecologies/Peet-Watts/p/book/9780415312363) p. 4) The political ecology approach is predicated on the notion that technocratic fixes are not sufficient to solve environmental problems, as environmental problems and crises are inexorably entwined with and rooted in relations of power, domination, and inequality in society. \n\nThe \"macro\" group engaged with the task of envisioning the transition to a circular mobility society by situating it in a broader socio-political context, and concluded that other structural changes were needed as predicates to such a transition. They proposed that circular mobility cannot really exist outside of a system that has adopted circular economy as a whole, where circular mobility is just one aspect. In turn, they envisioned political freedom as a predicate to that (the interlocutors were Turkish and commenting on the political order in Turkey at the moment, headed by Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, which they identified as \"fascist\"), and the mobilization of a democratic, decentralized education in the service of shifting the socio-economic norms towards circularity (both economic and more specifically pertaining to mobility).\n\nOn participant said: \"In the future \u2013 about the car sectors, I think we are going to use the cars less and less \u2013 there will be more use of the public transport\" suggesting that at the moment the car sector is so strongly mentally linked for some people with the private sector that even in an imagination exercise, it was difficult to decouple the two.\n\nAnother participant specifically identified their thoughts as being informed by an ecocritical perspective.[\"Emerging in the 1980s on the shoulders of the environmental movement begun in the 1960s with the publication of Rachel Carson\u2019s *Silent Spring*, ecocriticism has been and continues to be an \u201cearth-centered approach\u201d (Glotfelty xviii) the complex intersections between environment and culture, believing that \u201chuman culture is connected to the physical world, affecting it and affected by it\u201d (Glotfelty xix). Ecocriticism is interdisciplinary, calling for collaboration between natural scientists, writers, literary critics, anthropologists, historians, and more. Ecocriticism asks us to examine ourselves and the world around us, critiquing the way that we represent, interact with, and construct the environment, both \u201cnatural\u201d and manmade. At the heart of ecocriticism, many maintain, is \u201ca commitment to environmentality from whatever critical vantage point\u201d (Buell 11).\"](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_literature/literary_theory_and_schools_of_criticism/ecocriticism.html) In this specific example, ecocritical thinking refocused the conversational thread on rights to water (and possibly rights of water?) and advocated clean water as the condition guiding and limiting technological and mobility sectors. \n\nThis thread of conversation also noted the need for a new approach to urban planning, and emphasized how in a sense we as societies are stuck with very outdated models of urban planning in many places. The central point of the urban planning critique and how it connected to circular mobility was the notion that \"in the city people become more detached from nature\" (which mirrors an oft-discussed issue in social science literature, starting with Karl Marx's notion of stoffwechsel and the theory of [\"the metabolic rift\" later developed by Marxist sociologists like John Foster Bellamy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/210315). There was a suggestion that because nature works in cycles, closer re-connection with nature in the city (e.g. through establishment of urban farms) would help shift culture towards cycles and circularity in general. This suggestion/insight is very much in line with the approach of [biomimicry](https://biomimicry.org/) -- an interdisciplinary theory and practice of design in the broad sense that draws inspiration for problem-solving from nature.\n\nReflecting on the assignment, the \"macro\" group specified that they envisioned preconditions rather than steps being an optimal way to imagine this transition to circular mobility.\n\nThe \"micro\" group focused more on the specifics of this imagined world/city, although also engaged with the psychological/cultural shifts as well as technical details that would aid this transition to a circular mobility sector. They used the Stickies function on the Miro board to link some details of how this imagined circular mobility sector would function logistically with other imagined features of the world that contained it (they called the imagined future \"Point B\" -- see below):\n\n![imagined utopian future|206x690](upload://q0YIrm5UtFdJzdAabSUkOu1IbYA.jpeg)\n\nThey contrasted this imagined future with the current status quo that they characterized as lacking fun (in the sense of ludic culture/playfulness) and rife in obligations. \n\nThe extrapolation from the visualizations and debrief of the \"micro\" approach can offer the following insight: non-circular and resource-consuming mobility/car sector is connected with a highly structured regimented social existence centered around many specific obligations. A more socio-centric and need-centric society, with a basic income, and established local food security solution, would require a) less movement and b) fantasizing further, could also have room for objects to move around and come to people (e.g. a movable vertical urban farm feeding the city) requiring less movement around of cars. This imagines a car sector that is minimized rather than circular per se, but in the pursuit of similar environmental goals.", "post_number": 2, "reply_count": 1, "reads": 5, "readers_count": 4, "incoming_link_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 41.0, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "target_username": "ivan", "reply_to_post_id": 115833}, {"topic_id": 17703, "post_id": 116770, "username": "marina", "user_id": 4096, "created_at": "2022-08-31T15:47:54.642Z", "raw": "[Featured on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ch7YQzmKeRa/) ;)", "post_number": 3, "reply_count": 0, "reads": 5, "readers_count": 4, "incoming_link_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "score": 36.0, "reply_to_post_number": 2, "target_username": "Nica", "reply_to_post_id": 116492}], "16832": [{"topic_id": 16832, "post_id": 104558, "username": "ivan", "user_id": 6670, "created_at": "2022-04-20T14:43:17.504Z", "raw": "Map of the possible case studies for the Treasure project\n\nRecycling\n\n[Rinnovabili.it](https://www.rinnovabili.it/), in particular [batteries in the sea](https://www.rinnovabili.it/re-auto/stop-alle-batterie-esauste-mare-222/)\n\nCE\n\n[hub.brussels](https://hub.brussels/en/the-circular-economy-in-brussels/): a hub for companies operating in CE in Brussels.

Well, we have established that I am Dutch. I was born just outside Eindhoven and held up. I don't know if you are familiar with it. So I used to cycle to school every day past the DAF factory. So I've been a car guy from very early age. But then in the 1980s I worked for a management consultancy that specialized in the car industry, which was spun off from the University of East Anglia. And. I was monitoring really the the non-English speaking media. And it was quite clear that within the car industry, perhaps much more than in other industries, surprisingly enough, there was an increasing awareness of environmental pressures. Now a lot of that came from California, that California had the first emissions control regulations really specifically aimed at cars. And that really started in the late 1950s and was specifically originated in the Los Angeles area. Have you been to L.A.?\n\nSpeaker2: [00:08:53] I have. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:08:55] It's it's a funny place, but historically, I mean, you probably know about the tar pits and things like that, La Brea Tar Pits and things like that. That area where they built the city of Los Angeles is actually full of tar oil and stuff like that. So even when the Chumash Indians were about it was known as a place with bad air to build a massive city on it, stick it full of cars and trucks, have a massive port with ships, and obviously it's going to be one of the first places in the world to hit this problem. And as you know, it's it's it's got the sea on one side. It's got mountains essentially all the way around. So it's this basin that holds bad air, basically. So California's spotted this quite early on because they were one of the first motorized parts of the world as well because relatively they were relatively well off. So I've got this book written by somebody in Santa Barbara, actually, I bought it in Santa Barbara, California. That actually traces the history of that. And people first notices notice differences in air quality from about the 1940s onwards saying, well, when I moved to L.A., there was blue sky and now it's just brown. Why is that? And so they started to look into it, and therefore they were the first to really start to suggest that cars were the problem now because they were before federal legislation, they are still even today allowed to legislate separately from federal legislation, from the Trump administration.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:10:30] Tried to stop that, but it didn't quite work. So. California regulations will be created by the California Air Resources Board in Sacramento. And. Now, a number of other states also follow that. I mean, in the 1990s, a number of states decided, oh, we want what, California or we have our own rules. So the federal government said, well, all right, you can either follow federal legislation or you can follow California legislation, but nothing else. So it probably about 20 or 30 states now that also follow California regulations. So they've become quite important. Now, we first spotted this in well, in the early 1990s, by which time I had joined Cardiff Business School, Cardiff, Cardiff University Business School, Cardiff Business School at that stage had a centre for automotive industry research, and I was recruited into that basically as one of the researchers initially. So I because I had already been studying the car industry from an environmental perspective in, in my consultancy days, I brought that environmental perspective with me and with it. I also brought my first book, which published in 1992, The Green Car Guide. It's called Have I Got? Yes, yes, I have got a copy I can show you.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:11:56] Amazing.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:11:57] So I wrote that with two colleagues from my consultancy Days. But it was very early then at that stage, very, very few studies like that available anywhere spotted the California Air Resources Board were the key to it all, at least for emissions legislation, air quality legislation. So we started to visit them, contact them and things like that. So a lot of our sort of work was really going to Sacramento talking to the California Air Resources Board and then coming back to Europe and say, you know what's going to happen? And they thought we were great visionaries because they hadn't twigged this. So that was all good fun. But one thing we found all the way along, which was also very difficult to sell to our academic bosses, is that the car industry was actually aware of this thing from a very early stage, and even though they may not have acted accordingly, they knew what was coming and they had people in place who could deal with these technologies and things like that. So we then also said, listen, the impact of the car is not just tailpipe emissions, it's much broader. And that's also covered in that little book, The Green Car Guide, where we explore. There are other things you have to think about. So really during the 1990s, I started to pursue those different strands of activity because it was quite clear that states that the tailpipe emissions thing was sort of under control.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:13:31] It was a subject to a legislative trajectory, but the other things were not. And one of the areas was, for example, product durability. So I was one of the first to sort of emphasize this, this, this this habit we have of throwing away a car after 15 years is really stupid. So I started to do some research in that area as well, and that was picked up by some people at the time, including one guy at the New Economic Foundation here in the UK who have done similar work on white goods. And so we organized sort of a few workshops together where he did the sort of wide goods, consumer goods, and I did cars and things like that. And I'm still occasionally in touch with him. He's now at the university, both at Nottingham Trent University now still doing similar work and getting it funded. So that's one one of the things another thing we said, well, one of the problems of the car industry is essentially overproduction. And this is also the reason why cars are thrown away after 15 years, because cars are sort of pushed into the system at the front, making cars prematurely obsolete, and therefore people get rid of them.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:14:44] So we then started to get why are the production volumes as they are? And at that stage, me and my colleague Peter Wells, who I should mention who I did a lot of joint work with, I don't know if you've come across his name. Yeah, we did that. We did that work closely together. We started to look into where those economies of scale came from. We were both within the economic section of the business school at the time, and economists just seem to think economies of scale were economies of scale. But once we started digging, we we realized that's not the case. It's dependent on the technologies you use and the technology that the car industry uses that forces the economies of scale is the all steel body. You know, cars consist of basically a welded steel box. That is where the high investment is. And this was quite novel work. So we spent a lot of time on the history of mass production going into sort of stuffy libraries in the US and things like that. Looking through contemporary sources from 1910 to 1915 and things like that, and discovered this chap, Edward Budd, in fact, I was aware of him, but he developed the the all steel welded body. This is around 1912, 1914, so about the same time that Ford developed the moving production line.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:16:10] Now, we also discovered Ford did not mass produce cars. The Model T was essentially a running chassis. So it was a car without a body. Because if you go back historically, people saw the car as a mechanical device and then you took it to your coachbuilder and he he would put a body on it. That's how it was thought of. Whereas nowadays if you go into a car factory, I don't know if you've been. Probably not. All you see basically is is bits of steel being stamped welded into bodies, then the body being painted and things. And then some people come around to put seats in it and wheels on it and stuff like that, engines in it. But that was a key innovation. So we then discovered that this transition from the way Ford made cars, which is basically looking at how cars were in, say, 1905 and production using that to the way cars are made today. That was the crucial step. And it was Budd who was crucial, was key in that. And that really rolls out in the twenties and thirties and even beyond that. But the problem is because it's such high, such a capital intensive technology, it forces those economies of scale. So as a result, a modern car plant, it's break even point for a mass produced model is between 180,000 and 200,000 a year.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:17:35] The moment you fall below that, unless you're a specialist producer, you begin to lose money. So your only option is to produce at that level and then sell. So they're forced to move it in. So once we discovered this in the 1990s and we published about that, it's all in the public domain. We then say, Well, that is where your problem is. If you get rid of that technology, then you can go for lower economies of scale and therefore you're not forced to produce in those high volumes. You can then produce cars that can last longer and perhaps create a different business model whereby you produce the car and then you keep it in the market, you maintain it in the market and just keep it going. That's even not even looking at the circular economy side, but looking at the vehicle in use. So then we fortunately in the UK this country is stuffed with low volume car makers, right? So we did the rounds of them and then also went into Germany and Italy where you also got low volume car production. And we started to work with some of them. We did some work with Lotus, did a lot of work with Morgan. I don't know if you've heard of. Have you heard of any of these companies?\n\nSpeaker2: [00:18:44] Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:18:47] You know, Morgan makes Morgan makes a 1930 style car. It looks like that. Yeah. So we I was on a on a on a government advisory committee together with Charles Morgan. So I got to know him quite well. And he brought us in to do a lot of the work for him and also explained to his financial backers how his business model was completely different from that of the Fords and General Motors and things which he found very helpful at the time. He has since been kicked out of the out of the company, but still. So that was very interesting work. And then we got to understand how you can actually make cars in lower volumes and things like that. So we published on that. We published what turns out to have been quite an influential paper, not in academic circles, but in industry circles in 2000, whereby we proposed a new alternative business model that was really based on low volume manufacturer, a fracturing localised to to its market and then combined with a sales and maintenance model. So it's called micro factory retail whereby you have small industrial units that assemble cars and also the customer buy straight from those assembly facilities. They can specify the car to their needs, local suppliers can feed into it. And it means that if demand for new cars sort of declines, the company can deal with maintenance, repair, upgrading, recycling, etc., etc., etc.. Now, that was picked up by a number of people around the world, including local motors. So we've heard of them in the US. They use the what do you call it, a sort of a crowdfunding model whereby people can chip in and essentially design their own car using a centralised piece of basic software that they can help configure. But more interestingly, locally, we were approached by a guy called Hugo Powers.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:20:53] He's one of the cleverest people I've ever met. He's far too clever to to be successful. Anyway, he has set up since then a company called Simple, which you may not have heard of. It's based here in Wales. A simple one word. Yeah. Just Googled them. They have a nice website and they may be worth talking to. Although being a small business, they're very busy. He picked up this idea because he could see that ideas he had already been forming would fit quite nicely with this business model. So he got some backing from members of the Percy family and some other people. And he's developed a small hydrogen fuel cell car. That is essentially I mean, he's just beginning. It's just that he's building a fleet of 50 cars that are going to be placed with people in the local area. His business model is based on the sort of leasing. So a product service system, really. So you lease the car, then the company takes them back, reconfigures them for the next customer and things like that. They do all the repair and maintenance that's needed. One of his arguments was that when you look at the fuel cell cars that the industry does, and certainly Toyota and Hyundai and Korea, Korea who produce commercial fuel cell cars, they said they can figure there's a big American car that makes you feel so very big. But he said you can get small off the shelf fuel cells for next to nothing. So if you just configure a very lightweight small car around that, your whole car is much cheaper. So that's what he's done. So it's a very lightweight little car and it does everything you need it to do with it. So have.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:22:43] The smaller, more localized companies like the river sample, but also the local motors. And and in the.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:22:49] Us.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:22:51] It's obviously both of them are very localized businesses, right. Because if you need to have like maintenance done or anything, you need to be near that location just like specifying this, because I can imagine that this would as well be sort of a limiting factor for, for example, other parts of the world, right?\n\nSpeaker1: [00:23:11] Yeah. Yes, it does. And how you do it, Gordon Murray, I don't know if you've heard of Gordon Murray. He he designed the first carbon fiber monocoque Formula One car. So he for people into Formula One, he sits next to God and Gordon Murray has set up his business because after a while he said after about 20 years of doing racing cars, he said, I've done that. He also did a road car, the McLaren F1, which is supposed to be the best supercar ever made. Now I've never driven one, can't afford one. But yes, he he has an enormous prestige in the car industry. Anyway, he decided that around 2000 really had done that and now he wanted to do more environmental car design. So he also came to us and also picked up on the micro factory retailing idea and developed it himself. And his model is really that he develops concepts including the manufacturing concept and the product that can then be placed around the world. So you would have a network of factories, and that's also how we envisage the micro factory retailing concept. So not everybody needs to do the design. The basic design is something that's modularized and the factory is modularized, but then you can configure it locally for local tastes and to allow local suppliers to come in and things. And I can send you a copy of the paper if you actually I did a summary a couple of years ago for a journal that I can send you on a micro factory retailing concept. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:24:53] Okay. So there's a lot of very interesting things you already mentioned, I. I was wondering if you could go in a little bit more about what you were mentioning? Was the project your durability?\n\nSpeaker1: [00:25:07] Yeah.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:25:08] This is something. So one of the things that we were looking at and also like in communities that we think might know or even though they might not know, it's it's like a circular economy related or whatever, like communities that might find things like that useful for them. Or for example, off road, off road communities, people who take their cars out in the middle of nowhere that needs as it is not part of your ability, but maybe also flexibility. Maybe you have something to to share on that topic on like the ability to. Make a fixture by yourself without the need to go into like an expensive mechanic or a specialized mechanic, because currently with a lot of the especially the mass produced cars and I'm assuming as well with these localized businesses, is that the knowledge about how to fix them is very specialized and often specialized. Even specialized computers are needed to to run checks and to see what's like the error code. Right. So maybe you could go a little bit more into depth on that specific topic.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:26:16] But on the last point, I mean, with the transition to electric vehicles, the vehicle technology will actually become simpler than with internal combustion engine. So so that is an advantage. And you don't need stuff like emissions control, which of course is where a lot of the engine management computer work comes in. Now, going back to the durability thing, I mean, as you will be aware, most of most of humanity has been doing product durability for thousands of years. We didn't we didn't have a throwaway society that sort of has developed in the last 100 years or so. And if you look at what Henry Ford said, I mean, I quote him frequently, he was a fascist. But still, Henry Ford said when he sold the Model T, I want demand because women were supposed to buy cars. Of course, the man who buys one never to have to buy another. So he envisaged that if you bought your Model C, you would keep it for life, you see. So and there was a whole aftermarket industry, especially in the US that supply bits for it. So if your Model T was too basic and they were very basic, you could add all sorts of stuff to it. And a lot of that stuff was designed by ordinary drivers, ordinary citizens, small scale inventors and things like that.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:27:32] Now I describe this to some extent in my 2014 book plug. What happened in the 1920s and thirties is a gradual professionalization of the car and the car industry, whereby the car industry decided We don't want all these people tinkering with our products. We we want to control the whole thing and the extreme. It has now taken an extreme form in Tesla. Tesla has a total control system to the extent that if you start fiddling around with a Tesla, a voice will come out of the car and say, What are you doing to our cars? But we have long advocated the sort of hands on thing for various reasons. But product durability is not just the technological issue, it's also a psychological issue. You have to be able to build up a relationship with the product to to look after it and to make it last a long time. So I've I've done some papers on the classic car movement. I'm a classic car owner myself. In fact, my classic car is it's a Dutch duff. It does 55 coupe, of which there are very few in this country. And I'm also the chairman of the DAF Owners Club in this country.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:28:53] So I'm wondering how many members you have?\n\nSpeaker1: [00:28:58] 100.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:28:59] A hundreds.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:29:01] Hundreds? Yeah, yeah. It goes up and down, but around 100 and some people have more than one DAF and some people have half a dozen. So what interests me about apart from being part of it myself, but classic car thing here you get people who take essentially an old banger and just keep it going, spend money on it, and lavish a lot of love and attention on it just to keep it going. Because my Duff, 55, was designed for a working life of ten years and it's we're 50 years old now and it's still roadworthy. It passed its its periodic test, the mode, as we call it in Britain a few weeks ago and things like that. So you can't actually do these things. There is a guy in Switzerland who has published a lot on this sort of thing. He runs a I think.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:29:54] I'm terribly sorry, but my seven year old son is called.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:29:58] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. First things first.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:30:01] They. Now. Mommy is in the world right now. Okay? You have to be quiet so we can go back to. To remember if you want.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:30:16] Your.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:30:17] Mommy.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:30:21] Sorry.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:30:23] Usually. We?\n\nSpeaker1: [00:30:33] I.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:30:43] Yeah. Or you can watch. It sends them to the neighbors, but of course, they will come back right at the moment that you're in the middle of a work thing.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:31:02] Oh, yeah, I've actually been there. Okay. Yeah. For the last 20 years, I've spent a lot of time working at home. And of course, 20 years ago, my kids were a lot younger. They've now gone.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:31:14] Yeah. I've worked from home since he was born. But then with COVID, it was so much harder, of course. And now it's summer holidays, so. Okay, so we were talking about the the classic art movement, right? And how a lot of money and attention and effort is spent into keeping these old. Not even to actually last as long. And I think the psychological part is is extremely is extremely interesting.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:31:43] Yeah. And again, I've published on that. I mean, if you're interested in I can send you papers, but I don't know how much background reading you have time to do.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:31:51] I don't know either. But it will be great to have and I can always just also share with some other people who would be potentially interested. Right. We're like.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:32:01] You may have to remind me in an email which bits I said I would send you.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:32:05] Okay. Okay. Well, I've, I've made my notations, so. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:32:09] Yeah. Anyway. You have the classical movement, which I thought could form a model for future more durable car. So experiences car consumption, if you like. But that does mean that the manufacturer need to need to give up some of their control frequency. And that is going to be a real challenge. But I do notice that all over the world, sort of freedom to tinker legislation is popping up for various sectors. I think that's something that started in Massachusetts. But also I think the European Union has been talking about that recently that consumers will have will be given an inherent right to do things to the to the products once they've bought them. Now, this is where a slight problem comes in, because the environmental movement often advocates a product surface system approach whereby the end user doesn't own the product, but it's managed by the manufacturer or a management company. But that, of course means that you would have less ownership of the product and less of that bond. Well, within an ownership model, it's easier to build that bond. So that is something that needs to be resolved in some way. You can probably run both side by side. I mean, one of the PhD students that Tim Cooper at Nottingham, Trent, the guy I mentioned earlier, although I didn't mention his name, one of his PhD students worked on this Portuguese chap. I've forgotten his name, but I could dig it out. He said that one of the things a better product surface system. You can have more intensive use of a product if you think of car sharing schemes, for example, car clubs, that sort of thing.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:34:02] And he said, So you do in fact get the intensive life out of the product that in a shorter time period, then with the ownership model, you might get an intensive, you will get that life out of it, but it will just take longer. The only problem is if we are thinking of circular economy is controlling that waste stream because if you have a very intensively used product, you still have a fast waste stream and you need to to work out how to deal with that. Whereas with a personal ownership model, you could your waste stream can be delayed. So if a car lost 30 years instead of 15, that sort of delays the waste stream quite a bit and also some work done by Polish in the 1970s on behalf of the. The German government on assessing how long a car could be made to last by using different materials and things. If you approach Prussia now, they deny all knowledge of it. But I have a copy and I've referenced it in a lot of my work because they reckon that with minor improvements a car can easily be made and the 1970s technology car can easily be made to last 25 to 30 years. And in fact, with a lot of those improvements have been introduced subsequently, it's like galvanized bodies. For example, Audi introduced a whole lot of medium bodies, which is also advocated by Persia in that study and things like that. So stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:35:37] Yeah. A personal anecdote in there. So I live in over a decade now and as you may imagine that the car. Environment here is actually most people. I mean, there's, of course, a lot of new courses or newer cars, but no one buys cars new completely. Most cars are imported from those states, as you know, the insurance system in the states. So that give car insurance and you break your car, your insurer will pay for the full amount that your car is worth and then auctioned off. And so percent of the cars are imported here with some damages and then they're being fixed up and then they're being sold to the local market and to the regional markets of Central Asia. But the I would say most people I think, like, you know, that's like sort of like middle class, the age of their cars is going to be between 15 and 25 years.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:36:40] Old.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:36:42] Or older. So if you go to a lower class, you have easily 30, 35 year old cars and they're just being kept running, especially the older ones. I'm not sure how they're doing it, but like the mechanics will find solutions for basically everything. I guess I'm feeling that with the older cars it's easier for mechanics to find solutions than it is with the more newer cars because the parts are more specialized. But anyway, so this is like a I just wanted to give that anecdote in as well because when it comes to durability of the cars, I think if you look at countries like this, you can see that durability of cars can actually be really, really, really long. But of course, having a car here fixed is much cheaper because the. The mechanics don't charge a lot of salary. I had my car recently and my brakes had to be. Completely fixed. The disks were.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:37:40] Warped.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:37:42] Yeah, completely. And I paid for my front brakes. Both the disks and the. Yes, the parts. Thank you. I had everything changed around and I paid. For both for the parts and for the work. \u20ac40.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:38:06] Right? Well, interestingly enough, that's very interesting. I wasn't aware of that in Georgia. But we also did a study about 20 years ago about the flows of used cars around the world. We did go to the US, but we found flows from there to the Middle East, mainly of sort of Lincoln Town cars and stuff like that. But the most interesting flow we found was from Japan. In Japan, again, it's not the insurance thing, but they have a very strict periodic, periodic testing regime. Essentially, after five years, you have to completely rebuild your braking system and things like that. And cars are expensive to repair in Japan, but cheap to buy. So a lot of people decide after five or seven years they'll just buy a new car and there's old cars that are shipped off somewhere. Now, the biggest market for those is New Zealand. Now, New Zealand deports between 120 and 150,000 used Japanese cars every year. And again, most ordinary New Zealanders drive those used Japanese cars and just keep them going, which is very well made. And some flows go also from there into East Africa and places like that into the Caribbean. And then we found just starting about 20 years ago, a similar flow from South Korea into Russia via Vladivostok. I mean, you could actually see fishing boats from Russia with sort of several cars piled on the deck. So they're going off and offloading them there and selling there at great profit. So yeah, the first few cars around the world are very interesting and I think we are probably among the few who have done published work on that in that area.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:39:53] No, it's easier. You actually mentioned Japan because Georgia used to Japan was also a large stream of cars coming from Japan. But the Georgian government changed their laws on which.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:40:09] Steering wheel on the wrong side.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:40:11] Both sides were allowed and I think four years ago they changed it like you were not allowed to buy a car with your wheel on the other sides. So it's slowly phased out. Now you hardly see them anymore. And it was.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:40:28] Korea.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:40:30] Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I guess of all the companies that are here are really, really mostly focused on the states. Again, because the auction system is just it's so easy to buy like a car that has like minimal damage for a discount because again, the cost here to fix them up is so cheap. Labor is so.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:40:51] Cheap. It's really. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:40:54] Yeah. So yeah. Look, if you want, I have some context here in the art world that can get you in touch with. Yeah. So that was like that was like just again when we're talking about durability, that just came to mind because. And then your Japan comment was also very interesting in terms of like when the requirements are so high in terms of like. Technical inspection. Of course, it's done also to protect the common. You think so? What about. What about. What about safety?\n\nSpeaker1: [00:41:31] No, it's purely to protect the domestic car manufacturers. That's that's the main driver. And that's also why the German, too, is quite strict. And why in Germany you can't really modify cars. There's all sorts of restrictions like it specified what sort of alloy wheels you can fit to your cars in Germany, whereas here for example, you can stick anything on your light. So yes, you need a lot of that sort of legislation is driven by the car manufacturers under the guise of safety, but has very little to do with safety.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:42:05] So I definitely wasn't aware of this. So this is for me personally, for.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:42:09] Me to be an industry insider. Okay.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:42:15] Okay. So that is very interesting. And of course, the car I can imagine also that the car manufacturing lobby is quite strong and yeah. Money to spend as well.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:42:28] Yeah. Car manufacturing is the world's largest manufacturing industry still. And of course, as you will be aware, it's bigger in some countries than in others, especially in countries like Japan and Germany. But also the US has quite a strong car lobby and a very strong car union. The United Auto Workers in the US can put a lot of pressure on the government, for example, to stop car makers from producing in Mexico and things like that. And then metal in Germany, which which is the union also for the car industry, not just for the metal industry, is Europe's most powerful union. So, yes, unions and car makers in tandem sort of determine a lot of that sort of thing.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:43:14] That is very interesting. I'm going to stick to my notes. Thanks. You.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:43:19] Yeah. We haven't said that much about the circular economy yet.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:43:23] Yeah. No, and that's also I mean, that is that is fine. It doesn't have to necessarily 100% cover the circular economy. It just would like to start the debate going. I was thinking about the. Well, the overproduction we. Let's let's let's just hop into more to the circular economy part of. So what specific things if you research we did talk about it a little bit right when we were saying you were mentioning the the two different streams. When you talk about sustainability, one is like our ownership and the other one is like the leasing system. What else would you like to share it if you believe it's important for people to think about or to push for or.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:44:06] Well, we have a short chapter in our latest book, which was published a couple of years ago, where we sort of review some of it. But when we first came, Peter and I first came across the circular economy thing in the 1990. So there's one thing that struck us because this coincided with the work we were doing on looking at alternatives for mass production. And it occurred to us that the circular economy model assumed a sort of static technology situation. So of course steel from which most cars are made is very recyclable. But if you don't build a circular economy system around that, that assumes your car are made of steel. And just at the time that we were doing this work, alternative materials were coming into cars. You had things like the Renault Espace and I don't know if you remember it, but now it has essentially galvanised steel framework onto which there are plastic panels. Right. So it's a mixed technology. And I also mentioned the aluminium Audi's Jaguar also makes largely aluminium. A lot of companies now make aluminium cars. Now aluminum is also recyclable, but that means that you then need to find demand for both the steel and the aluminium. Then you get an awful technologies like the BMW i3. We spent some time with BMW looking at how the i3 is made. I don't know if you know the i3.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:45:34] It's a little BMW electric car. It's built on an aluminium platform and then it has a carbon fibre superstructure. Now carbon fibre is a bugger to recycle. The only thing you can do really, is to grind it down and use the powder you get as a filler for other products. Now, the Mini was, of course, perfectly recyclable. On the other hand, a structure like that of the BMW i3 should last 40 or 50 years without too much problem. Right. So you get those all those trade offs. Now, another thing is we're in the middle of a transition from internal combustion engines to electric motors. So internal combustion engines produce a lot of work in the engine is called coarse engine blocks and things are stuff you can melt down and turn into new. Castings either out of cast iron or aluminium, but. You've got that input. Do you necessarily have a demand for whatever it produces? So that's why another thing we flagged up is how do you understand your circular economy? Do you? Do you? I have the circularity within one product, within one product, one in one industry, within one sector, within a locality, within a region. I mean, what how does your circularity work? Because at the moment, a lot of the recyclers from various industries end up in other kinds of products, like old tires, end up in playground sort of rubble, things like that.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:47:18] But from talking to the people who promote the circular economy concept, the loops are much closer. And so that is something I have not seen fully discussed or fully resolved. So that's something else we flagged up. Let me get the book and see what else. There are three points we mentioned specifically. Yes. I mean, the first point is that close loop homes in on reuse and recycle. Well, overusing. Well, overlooking the most important to reduce. We've covered that sufficiently, I think, in discussion. And then the other one is creating a static system whereby material innovations are discouraged because you put new stuff in. Like lithium, for example, is a classic now with lithium batteries. But if you then if you then change the battery technology to to other ones and there are lots of other technologies in the pipeline, what do you do with all the waste lithium from the older batteries, from current crop of cars? How do you how do you accommodate that? These things can all be done, but you need to be prepared for this. Those things. What level? Yeah. This refers to the waste hierarchy. Have you have you come at the waste hierarchy to sort of reduce, reuse, recycle sort of thing? Just Google waste hierarchy and it will pop up. It's widely used in our area, really. And then this final point, the third point is the one I just made is what is your the area within which you.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:49:03] Which loop operates. So it says a closed loop tends to be too vague as to whether the loop should be closed within a single product type, e.g. mobile phones, computers, cars within one sector, e.g. construction or within one economy. And if so, is that a local, regional or national economy? So those are our main three areas of concern about the closed loop economy. And when we first looked at it in 1990, it had not been addressed. And I've been to some conferences in recent years, as have some of my co-authors on this book, and we've still not seen people discuss that in any detail. So at the moment, the concept is still too theoretical to conceptual, and yet now is the time when we really need to get to the nuts and bolts of how we're going to do this. And we I mean, the data is coming through. I mean, one of my former PhD students is involved in the car battery recycling programs and things like that. So the information is coming out of what sort of material flows will be produced in the future, how they are different from existing material flows and stuff like that. But we really I mean, within the circular economy community, these things really need to be addressed.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:50:21] So it really is then sort of a gap where.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:50:26] They can see. I mean, it's possible that in my absence something has happened behind my back. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:50:33] Like I said, I did a bit of desk research and not too much came up. So to be honest, again, I am not doing the academic research myself on it, but in terms of looking to people to talk.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:50:50] My other one of my co-authors on this book. This is the most recent one and public. She's still an active academic. I'm technically retired from academia. And she also said she hadn't come across anything. And she's actually been to some recent conferences. So there we go. I think that stands. I can I can send you that little chapter. It's only a few pages.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:51:15] Yeah. So there's this is a chapter from. From which book of yours.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:51:20] Which which it's it's snappily titled Sustainable Consumption Production and Supply Chain Management.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:51:32] And so I know what to write you.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:51:40] So that's. You see, when that was published. 2021.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:51:51] Very recent. Very recent.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:51:53] That is my most recent book.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:51:56] Okay, great. Is there anything else you would like to share or anything else you think?\n\nSpeaker1: [00:52:02] I should probably. I can talk. Talk about this for weeks. So it's really easier if you ask specifically. But it is definitely true that Peter and I are probably within academic circles, the foremost experts in in the whole sustainable car world. Well, I mean, we used to be advising the OECD and things like that, and they would get us all together and said, Oh, you're among the 50 top experts in this field. The others were mainly from consultancy companies or car companies and things like that. So we were really the only academics. So if you talk to Peter or myself, Peter is still active east. He's younger than me, so he's not retired. Although I'm retired from academia, I'm not retired from research, so I still do various projects and things like that. I managed to get rid of all the boring stuff.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:53:00] Nice. Well, I just have like. I think this is like a really good sort of introduction into and I think like a really nice sort of article out of this that sort of like gets conversation going. I'm also wondering if it would be okay if I reached out to you at a later stage?\n\nSpeaker1: [00:53:16] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I'm happy to talk about these things because there are not enough people interested in it.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:53:23] Oh, that's great. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I also probably would like to I mean, I'll have to discuss this with my my team as well in terms of how many experts interviews we want, because it's mostly about really like sort of like grassroots having people that are into cars start talking about the idea of like the economy and sustainability. But we definitely do want to have some expert voices, of course, to. To build awareness and to have that, you know, an understanding of what's all involves. So, yeah, if that's okay with you, I definitely would like to reach out to.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:53:58] No problem at all. But yes, it would be very interesting to find out to what extent raise public awareness of this issue.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:54:05] So far, my colleague has been going to a lot of car shows in the Bay Area and asking these questions. And so far it was a bit not not I would say not disappointing. Yes, but not.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:54:22] Surprising. No, no, no try.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:54:25] Yeah. Yeah. So. But people were interested once they found out more about it, to learn a bit more about it. So it wasn't like. But yet the people who went to the car shows were not necessarily people who are in this sustainability and circular economy circles. So that's why I definitely would like to have also an event on this topic.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:54:44] I think. I think that's that's again, where I think the work that Peter and I did was interesting because both Peter and I are also environmentalists. Yeah, but also when you go around the car world, you do find that actually far more people who are environmentally aware in the industry and in the organisations around the industry than you might think. Yeah. Probably more than among ordinary users. Now, there are some countries, as you may be aware, that are actively promoting the closed loop thing, like Sweden, for example. So it would be interesting to find out if in Sweden there is more sort of consumer awareness of this issue among car owners, car users. And Sweden also has a has a thriving classic car community.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:55:30] Although Tesla is also very popular in Sweden and the Scandinavian.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:55:35] In Norway, in particular in Norway. So yeah, it would be interesting to do all three Scandinavian countries if you have the resources.\n\nSpeaker2: [00:55:45] It's a small project that we're having. It is a two year project, but the budget we're having is it's not massive unfortunately. But this is definitely we have some people in Sweden, so we can send some people out on the streets.\n\nSpeaker1: [00:55:56] Like this is I think if you're networked properly, you can send people locally to do things. That's how we've often worked as well.

Da w\u00fcrde es jetzt keinen Sinn machen, ein Tempolimit auf der Autobahn zum Beispiel einzuf\u00fchren, weil der geringe Anteil, der dann weniger ausgesto\u00dfen wird, ist relativ belanglos. Und dadurch, dass manche Fahrzeuge auch unterschiedlich \u00fcbersetzt sind und dann sagen wir bei 150 im f\u00fcnften Gang weniger verbrauchen, als wenn du die ganze Zeit mit 110 im vierten da rumfahren, ist das f\u00fcr mich ja, man k\u00f6nnte besser an anderen Punkten anfangen, vielleicht mit der Umwelt, sie halt die Verschmutzung zu verbessern, anstatt jetzt auf Krampf das mit den Autos zu versuchen, weil man, es ist auch oft sehr schlecht angesehen mit schnellen Autos in Deutschland und das sind immer die \"bl\u00f6den Heizer\" und so was alles. Ja.\n\n\n\nMit Nachhaltigkeit, bez\u00fcglich Thema Autos jetzt wenig, da ich da selber nicht fahren darf. Aber ich kaufe zum Beispiel nicht Plastikflaschen, ich trink immer nur aus Glasflaschen oder habe so eigene Beh\u00e4lter und sowas f\u00fclle die immer auf. Ich kaufe generell kein Wasser, ich trinke zu Hause selber noch aus dem Hahn, solche Sachen und filtere das auch. Ja. Das f\u00e4llt mir gar nicht viel ein.

A: Wenn es funktioniert gut, aber wenn es nicht funktioniert, ist es schei\u00dfe. Und wenn es wirklich nicht funktioniert, kostet es eben Geld. Schluss. Kleines Beispiel: Ich habe in der Wende 90/91, 1989 Wolga in Zahlung genommen, ein russischen Wolga Gas 21, da habe ich gesagt, ich will das Auto nicht, ich will das nicht. Der wollte unbedingt Opel kaufen, blabla, Vectra was es war. Da sagte ich, komm ich geb dir 500 Mark. Ich wollte, das Ding, Schei\u00dfding nicht. Das ist ja ja 30 Jahre gestanden, bis jetzt. 30 Jahre. Und dieses Auto habe ich jetzt vor paar, vor zwei Monaten oder wann es war zum Laufen gebracht. Ich obwohl ich nicht so, ich bin schon technisch versiert, aber der l\u00e4uft ja. 500 Mark, wenn richtig ist. Ich bin in die, vor zwei Jahren in die Ukraine gefahren, habe Teile geholt und jetzt wieder in Berlin-Brandenburg habe ich auch, sogar neue Teile habe ich da bekommen, da bekommst du ja keine Teile mehr. Ich w\u00fcrde von so einem Auto sage ich Teile, geht nicht. Da war aber ein H\u00e4ndler, der Neuteile gehabt hatte. Ich kauf alles, ich kaufe alles. Und jetzt liegen die Autos zwischen 8.000 Und 15.000 \u20ac. Ja, soll ich eine Rendite von 90 bis jetzt, also eine gute Rendite. Und dann sagt man, ja, du hast auch ein bisschen Miete zahlen und so, und da sage ich: Pass mal auf, die Vergangenheit interessiert mich nicht und die Zukunft interessiert mich nicht.\nDie Gegenwart, das ist Autos, vielleicht 8, 9, 10 oder 12.000 \u20ac bringt. Das interessiert mich, aber ich verkaufe es ja nicht. Ich sage es ganz brutal das ist meine Altersvorsorge. Ja, nee, wenn ich meine ganzen Auto zusammenz\u00e4hle und ich w\u00fcrde sogar mal 400.000 \u20ac bekommen und bekomme blo\u00df 200.000 \u20ac. Das ist auch gut, aber es ist eine Hausnummer. 200.000. Ja, ja und die Spritfresser. Und die (andere Leute, Anm.Red.) sehen ja immer nur das Negative. Als Beispiel: Ich habe \u00fcber 50 Autos. Da sagen von 100 sagen vielleicht 5 %: Du machst richtig, du kaufst die Autos irgendwann, l\u00e4sst sie stehen und dann bringen sie Geld. Und die anderen sagen, die was wei\u00df ich wie viel, die die 90 %: Ja, das bringt doch nichts. Was willst im Alter? Schmei\u00df doch weg, oder oder egal was f\u00fcr Auto. Ich sage, ich halte die und versuch die zu halten. Und ich habe jetzt zwei Mercedes verkauft, die habe ich  auch g\u00fcnstig eingekauft und habe bestimmt das Dreifache bekommen. Ja, wo ist das Problem? Es gibt immer noch auf der Welt viele Menschen, die Auto-Freak sind. Nicht hier in Ulm oder in Stuttgart, \u00dcbersee Ausland, China, USA.
